I woke up this morning to find my cable modem not working. This is a problem, because I had planned to work on all sorts of interesting things today &#8211; all of which have an online requirement. After a phone call to confirm that I hadn't simply forgotten to pay my bill, I just sat there staring at the lights on the modem, trying to turn them back on purely by my own will.

The disturbing part for me is that I feel almost lost without a broadband connection. I'm sitting here thinking, "now what do I do?" It's not that my house is completely in order &#8211; it's a mess. It's just that I dont **want** to clean right now, I want to surf, and work and research and read email.

I wonder where I left the vacuum.
