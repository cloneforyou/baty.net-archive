When dealing with software development, the urge to add every feature asked for is almost impossible to resist&#8230;

"Can it do such-and-such?"

"Sure, I'll add that this week"

"Cool, thanks!"

Bad idea. With that attitude comes bloat, incoherent interfaces and other nasties.

Steve Jobs, speaking about innovation in [a recent interview][1] said "&#8230;but it&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;s only by saying no that you can concentrate on the things that are really important."

I like that.
