<span class="drop_cap">T</span>he checkout line at my local grocery store depresses me. Not because I'm forced to wait in line, that's fine. It's the magazine covers that get me. Vapid, silly headlines on covers filled with half-dressed women who look unnaturally perfect proclaiming ridiculous ways to either look like them or get them into bed.

The Kindle and other book readers have demonstrated how cool e-ink technology is. And now, e-ink displays are showing up on magazine covers. Can you imagine what the checkout experience will be if (when) this catches on? I'm not looking forward to that.
