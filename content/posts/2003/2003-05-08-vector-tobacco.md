With any luck and a little help from [Vector Tobacco][1]
  

  
, I should be able to start smoking again soon.

From the site:
  
</p> 

"We develop and market smoking products with science-based reductions in certain harmful elements."
  
</p> 

Sounds good so far, but one of the news items makes me less comfortable than I'm sure they'd like:

"Study Shows That Omni Causes Significantly Fewer Tumors in Mice Than Leading Cigarette Brand"
  
</p> 

Nothing like "fewer tumors" as a selling point, eh?</p>
