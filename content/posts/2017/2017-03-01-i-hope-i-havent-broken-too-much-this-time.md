I happened to see the [Hugo 0.19 release
announcement](http://bepsays.com/en/2017/02/27/hugo-019/) and didn't
think too much of it until I read this...

> Native Emacs Org-mode Support

Well now!

I installed it and tested with a few Org files and between my love of
static sites and Org Mode I've replaced everything with a new
Hugo-generated version. Again.
