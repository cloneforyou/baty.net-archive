I've been watching the [amfphp
  

  
project][1] pretty closely. It's basically Flash Remoting via PHP, and
  

  
open source as well. There has been little word on whether Macromedia
  

  
was going to give the project any grief over its use of the Action
  

  
Message Format. There is a new article titled [Connecting
  

  
Macromedia Flash and PHP][2] whice seems to indicate that they'll
  

  
endorse it, at least initially.
