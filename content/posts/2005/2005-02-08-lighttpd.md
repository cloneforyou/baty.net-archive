We all know and love the Apache web server, but if you're like me you never even consider alternatives because there's really nothing else out there, right? (IIS is not considered an alternative, BTW.) There's been some noise recently about [lighttpd][1]. Reading through the documentation has peaked my interest. FastCGI built-in (which wasn't even a consideration until this whole Ruby on Rails thing cropped up), simple virtual hosting, and easy to grok URL rewriting engine, plus the other usual suspects. What's nice is that looks to be small, fast and very scalable. I don't have a real-world use for it yet, but it certainly looks like one to watch.
