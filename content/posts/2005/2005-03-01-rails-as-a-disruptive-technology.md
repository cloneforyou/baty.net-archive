[David Heinemeier Hansson writes][1] about Ruby on Rails as "disruptive technology"

The sacrifices are condemned by the high priest exactly because of their status as high priests, which means they work on the most complex projects and hence cast all decisions on technology in that context. Would this work for the 5% most difficult projects? If not, then it "doesn't scale."
