Reading a Stephen King novel is something I haven't done in quite some time. With my [recently renewed desire to read][2], I thought I'd give it a go with [Duma Key][1]<img src="https://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=jackbaty-20&#038;l=as2&#038;o=1&#038;a=1416552510" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />

At 600 pages it's not a short read. I love the characters and creeping sense of dread King invokes, but in the end it didn't amount to much more that an inconsistent ghost story. Let's say 3 out of 5 stars
