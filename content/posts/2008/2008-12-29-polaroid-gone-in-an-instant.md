title: Polaroid â€“ Gone in an instant

So Polaroid is officially ending production of instant film this month. I've not used a polaroid camera since my grandpa let me play with his back in the 70s. It's still a little sad to see it go. If you're at all nostalgic for instant film, watch this video about the SX-70 camera. It's long but fascinating.
