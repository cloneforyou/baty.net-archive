I just found a python script that will take the output from `svn diff` and run it through FileMerge.app so there's a nice pretty visual diff to look at. 

It's called svndiffshim.py and can be found [here][1]. 

To use it, copy the script somewhere (like ~/bin) and make sure it's executable (`chmod +x ~/bin/svndiffshim.py`) 

Then add something like the following to your ~/.subversion/config file&#8230; 


`
<pre>

[helpers]

diff-cmd = /path/to/svndiffshim.py
