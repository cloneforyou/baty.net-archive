Some of the smartest people I know swear by a terminal-based, text-only workflow. They tell me that Vim and tmux and Markdown and a terminal are all anyone ever needs. I love the idea, but it never works.

I'm comfortable in Vim and I'm learning to utilize tmux and I write most everything in Markdown. I can fly around in files and panes using only the keyboard and I find there's nothing like Vim for the sheer pleasure of editing text. It's all pretty awesome. But let's be honest, unless text is the _only_ thing you're dealing with, it's also very _limited_.

Viewing a directory listing of text files, no matter how [consistently named][1] just isn't that useful to me compared to something like an outline of rich text notes in [Tinderbox][2] or a notebook full of text and images and PDFs in [Evernote][3]. Even a list of notes in [nvAlt][4] is better.

Writing anything of substance in Vim, no matter how tweaked out [my .vimrc][5] gets, is never as smooth and comfortable as I'd like. Invariably, I get lazy and go back to writing in something like [Ulysses][6][^1]. At least it's not Word, right?

Speaking of Ulysses. When Ulysses III came out I was initially disappointed that they'd "dumbed" it down from the version I was used to. I was wrong. They hadn't dumbed it down, they just made it so _I_ could be dumber while letting the software do the work. And that's the key. With a text-only workflow in a terminal, I feel that I have to do too much of the work. I either have to remember hundreds of arcane key commands (both the commands and that the commands are available) or I have to write something to do the work for me and wrap it up nicely. I'd rather just start writing.

Where does that leave me, text-wise? Unfortunately the jury is out, but right now I'm in sort of a middle ground of using text files but managing and writing them in fancy tools. I still create a lot of text files, formatted using Markdown[^2], but when writing anything more than a quick note, I use Ulysses or [Tinderbox][7]. I always have an iTerm/tmux window open for when I need a terminal: making quick text file edits, managing todos using [taskwarrior][8], etc. I think it's a pretty nice mix of both worlds.

So while I'm not ready to commit to all-text-all-the-time in a terminal, I can still reap many of the benefits without working too hard.
