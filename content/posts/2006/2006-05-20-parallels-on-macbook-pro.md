  It's pretty sweet being able to easily test web sites in IE and never leave my MacBook Pro. Setting up <a href="http://www.parallels.com/en/products/workstation/">Parallels</a> was a piece of cake. It's still beta, and has crashed once or twice, but I'm sure the final product will take care of that. Using full-screen mode and virtual desktops to switch between XP and OS X is a little freaky &#8211; in a good way.
