My grandfather's photo albums are stacked in my basement. There are 24 of them. My plan has been to scan, caption, and upload everthing. It's been slow going, but I'm picking away at it. 

I've been trying to decide where and how to post the images. Should I use Wordpress, or Flickr, or Facebook, or SmugMug, or what? While deciding, I exported the albums from Lightroom to static galleries and dropped them on my VPS with a bare-bones index page. This is the simplest thing possible and is probably good enough and definitely more permanent than the other options.

So for now, they're going here: [richard.baty.net](http://richard.baty.net/).
