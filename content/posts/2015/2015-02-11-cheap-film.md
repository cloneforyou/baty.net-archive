For 35mm color negatives, I've always shot either Portra 400 or Fuji Pro 400H; both great films. Also, Â at between $7.50 and $10.00 per roll, they're expensive. And let's face it, I'm shooting fast and loose, taking what most would call snapshots. It's not art, that's for sure.

Since I'm not creating art, I thought I'd try some cheaper films. I'm going to give the "consumer" films from Kodak and Fuji a try. I'm told both scan very well on the [Pakon][1]. At around $3.00/roll it's worth testing. I'm expecting to not see a significant difference, which could save me a lot of money.
