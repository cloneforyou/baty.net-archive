People make fun of me for having too many blogs. I don&#8217;t blame them. I just like to try things. I love a Saturday morning with nothing going on other than installing some new app and running with it. It&#8217;s fun!

The trouble begins when I say to myself, &#8220;That&#8217;s it, _this_ is where I&#8217;m writing from now on!&#8221; Of course that never lasts, and I look flighty and a little foolish. I no longer believe myself when I say those things. I&#8217;m never going to be the guy who&#8217;s been using the same platform in the same place for years, and that&#8217;s ok.

I&#8217;ve created sort of a mess of things, but I may just need to live with it. Here are the places I can currently publish, not including social media:

  * [jack.baty.net][1] is what you&#8217;re reading now (WordPress)
  * [baty.net][2] is my original blog (since 2000) most recently built with Hugo
  * [stream.baty.net][3] is a micro blog using [Known][4]
  * [tilde.club/~jbaty][5] totally static HTML because nostalgia!
  * [photos.baty.net][6] is my photo blog (WordPress)
  * [1999.baty.net][7] is for quick, loose notes ([1999.io][8])
  * [snippets.baty.net][9] was a micro blog (WordPress)
  * [baty.blog][10] is a test blog using [Blot.im][11]
  * [micro.baty.net][12] is a micro blog managed by [micro.blog][13]

&nbsp;

It&#8217;s pretty obvious that this is too much. I&#8217;m not sure what to do about it so I&#8217;m leaving it alone for now. Eventually I hope to consolidate things a bit and archive and shut down the places I never plan to use.
