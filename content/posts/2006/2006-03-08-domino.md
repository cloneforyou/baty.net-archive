![Domino][1] 

Whatever you do, do NOT see [Domino][1]. Of course if you actually enjoy having every irritating and gimmicky visual director trick thrown at you almost non-stop for two hours, then by all means, rent it. 

Tom Waits shows up near the end, but his character is completely unfathomable and by that time you won't care. Add to that a completely irrelevent Jerry Springer segway and Christopher Walken yelling "Why did you change the fucking font!?" over and over again and you've got yourself a noisy, stupid, confusing mess of a film. Tony Scott shouldn't be allowed to make movies like this. No one should. </p>
