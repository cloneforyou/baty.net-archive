I've been keeping notes and todos in one notebook or another for years. I prefer it that way, but it can be difficult to find things later and sometimes I can't decide what goes in the notebook and what goes elsewhere and why. Ryder Carroll recently solved those issues for me by created a wonderful and slightly more structured system called [The Bullet Journal][1]. It's simple and flexible but contains enough _process_ to make it the first paper-based "system" I've ever stuck with for any length of time.
  
He's now started a [Kickstarter project][2] so I backed it immediately.

> This Kickstarter campaign will fund development of the next version of&#160;bulletjournal.com: a stronger, smarter, more intuitive platform that will make it easy for users to find and contribute new methods to make the Bullet Journal system even more useful and effective.&#160;The new site will serve as a free library for the ever-growing catalog of productivity methods.&#160;The revamped site will also feature fresh tutorials, videos, reviews, resources, and so much more! 

Including a Leuchtturm1917 notebook makes it worth the price of admission. I like them much better than the typical Moleskine.
  
Here's hoping it gets funded!
