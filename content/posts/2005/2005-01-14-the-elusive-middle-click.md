I was lamenting the fact that I missed being able to middle-click a link in Firefox on OS X and have the link open in a new background tab. You know, like it did on my Windows box. [Dan][1] overheard this and told me about customizing the button behaviour using the Microsoft (yes, Microsoft) mouse control panel. Sure enough, I added the Firefox.app and assigned the middle button to Cmd-Option-Click. All better now, thank you.
