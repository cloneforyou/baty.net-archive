I know, you're aware of the Steven Poole piece. You've used WriteRoom for \_years\_. Everyone heard the Mark Cuban thing before I mentioned it, and so on. 

Sorry &#8216;bout that. 

The cool thing is that almost every time I link to something useful or interesting, someone will write to thank me for pointing it out. Surprising how few people have heard of the things that "everyone" already knew about.
