title: Strategies for Categorizing Categories

This month's UETips (from [uie.com][1]) includes some reasearch notes about categorization on several large e-commerce sites. I've included the text of the message&#8230;

How does a site containing thousands of pages of content get users to
the content they seek quickly? There are many different strategies for
organizing content on sites and we recently took a hard look at five
of them.

We've been examining several e-commerce sites to see how they
handled the problem of categorizing large numbers of products. We were
interested in seeing if the different designers came up with different
methods and which methods were most effective.
Our recent apparel and home goods study turned out to be a good place
to start. Here we looked at thirteen different sites, each with a
similar product set.

Every site had some similar characteristics. First, they divided the
content into just a few top-level categories, such as "Women", "Men",
and "For the Home". (Apparel is one of the few content types that
lends itself to such easy organization. Sites containing content such
as office supplies or support problems probably have to adopt
different top-level solutions, such as what Staples
[http://www.staples.com] has done.)

Also, they had similar pages that displayed pictures of all the items
within a given category. We call these pages product galleries. While
the number of items and the specific information that was presented
with each product image varied, all of the sites had basically the
same galleries.

What was different were the pages between the home page and the
galleries. We call these "department pages", because they represent
what's sold in a specific store's departments. For these sites,
"departments" were categories such as women's swimwear or table linen.
Among the thirteen sites we studied, we found five different
department-page designs. Most listed the departments in a left
navigation panel, with the galleries for that department listed in the
center. (Look at Macy's department pages&#8212;http://www.macys.com&#8212;by
clicking on Women, then Tops.)

However, some got clever. For example, the Gap and Victoria's
Secret (<http://www.gap.com>, <http://www.victoriassecret.com>) both used
a menu based department that wasn't a separate page, but instead used
menus at the top of the screen.

Old Navy (<http://www.oldnavy.com>) used a combination department and
gallery page where sometimes the left nav contains galleries and
sometimes it contains products. (Try clicking on Girls, then
Accessories. Compare that to clicking on Girls, then Skirts &
Dresses.)

Lands' End (<http://www.landsend.com>) used a design that had both
product descriptions and departments. (Click on Women's, then
Swimwear to see their department page design.)

Finally, Eddie Bauer (<http://www.eddiebauer.com>) combined text lists
of all the products in the department with a toggle to see the
pictures for a gallery. (Click on Women, then Sweaters. Click on View
Photos to see a specific gallery.)

After realizing that there were five basic types, we got very excited
about seeing if the different types made a difference. While we'd
expect differences between individual sites, it wasn't clear that we'd
see if an entire type of design outperformed others.

After watching people shopping on the sites, we compared their
behaviors. (As with many of our e-commerce studies, these users came
to our facilities with a list of products they wanted to buy. We gave
them the money to make the purchases and told them to purchase as much
on their list as possible. In this particular study, there were 44
users who shopped for a total of 687 products.)

Studying the different designs on apparel and home goods sites turned
out to be a good thing. Out of the 687 shopping expeditions that we
observed, users only used the search engine 22% of the time. That
means that 78% of the time they used the categorization scheme to
locate their desired products.

We found the sites with the standard left-nav design, such
as Macy's, actually performed the worst, selling the least
amount of product. Lands' End's design performed the best, with Old
Navy's combination design being second.

It turned out, in our study, that the number of pages that a user
visited before they put something into their cart was inversely
proportional to purchasing. The more pages they visited, the less they
bought. (Remember, our users knew exactly what they wanted and were
ready to make a purchase.)

When you look at the number of pages visited before a user put
something into their cart, users who traveled through Lands' End's
design purchased by visiting half the pages than users through Macy's
design. Lands' End's design had fewer visits to "wrong galleries"&#8212;
galleries that didn't contain the user's desired content (often
forcing the user to hit the "back" button&#8212;a clear sign of a
problem).

If you compare Lands' End's design to Macy's, you see some
interesting differences. By just looking at Macy's ' "Women's Tops"
department to Lands' End's "Women's Sweaters", you can see that Lands'
End goes to great length to let people have information they need to
make a decision. They give categories, such as "Twinsets",
"Cardigans", and "Cashmere".
Whereas Macy's just lists "Sweaters". Visiting the sweaters gallery
shows every sweater Macy's sells, with no distinction between the
types of sweaters or fabrics used. Users have to look at each sweater
to determine if it's what they are interested in.

With the Lands' End design, users could either go straight to a
product that was of interest to them or look at the category's gallery
by clicking on a "View these and more" link. While a lot of our users
clicked on products, many viewed the gallery before choosing their
product.

The Lands' End design can serve as a model for other types of
content. We could see job listing databases, news stories, or other
large content repositories using a similar design. For example, we
wonder if A.G. Edwards' In Focus story page
(<http://www.agedwards.com/public/invedu/infocus>) could benefit from
this type of design? We think it might.

(To be fair, A.G. Edwards has done a great job on the launch of
the new design. We feel a little guilty about picking on one page
out of many -- but it is such a great example of the particular
problem we're talking about. We just hope the great folks at A.G.
Edwards will forgive us.)

The pictures on Lands' End's department page were helpful sometimes
and ignorable the rest. Seeing a picture of a "twinset" helps identify
what it is, whereas the pictures of "Fine Gauge Cotton" and regular
"Cotton" could be swapped and nobody would probably notice or care
(except Lands' End's buyers). This means that content that doesn't
lend itself to pictures (such as diseases) doesn't really need them&#8212;
it's not a necessary part of this specific design.

As we study the differences in the designs of these department pages,
we can learn more about how to design information displays that are
more effective to getting users to their desired content.
