I made quite a fuss earlier about how foolish it is that so many poor saps are losing their digital images due to hardware or other failures. Well, that's not much worse than losing your negatives to incompetence. I just dropped of a roll of XP2 at the local Walmart. An hour later I picked up the CD full of images and headed home. Loading the CD into my laptop, I eagerly started copying them over to the drive. The odd thing was that not only were the photos in color, I didn't recognize any of the people or places in them! Why? You guessed it &#8211; they weren't my photos. I drove back to Walmart and they of course couldn't find mine.&nbsp; Sigh.
