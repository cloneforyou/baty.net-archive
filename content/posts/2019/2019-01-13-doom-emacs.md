Well [this](https://www.baty.net/2019/mastering-emacs-again/) was a terrible
idea.

I learned a lot, but, with apologies to Emacs purists, there's just no way using
Emacs keybindings makes sense for me as long as
[Evil-mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) is available. I'm hardwired for
modal, Vim-like editing, and can imagine no benefit that would make it worth the
necessary rewiring needed in order to switch.

But, I don't want to go all the way back to Spacemacs so I'm once again giving
[Doom-emacs](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs/tree/develop) a shot.

Doom feels lighter, faster, and easier to configure and customize so I'm running
with it.
