My own little anthropology experiment, [The Refrigerator Project][1] on Flickr only has 22 members at this point. I was worried no one at all would join, but a [recent post][2] on the [Flickr blog][3] helped a little.

Join, post a photo of your fridge, and don't forget to "copiously annotate" it afterward. That's the interesting part of the whole thing!
