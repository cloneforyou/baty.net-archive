If you're like me (and you are), you loathe the latest 2 or 3 releases of Windows Media Player. Make it all better with [Media Player Classic][1]. It's about a 700k download and a single executable. No installer, no bloat, just plays movies. It also supports Quicktime, AVI, Realmedia, DVD and anything else you might need. Really nice change of pace for a media player.
