One of the factors[^factors] causing me to bounce between publishing using a
static blog generator ([Hugo](https://gohugo.io)) and Wordpress is the option to
have conversations. To _participate_.

Wordpress makes this easy with a number of Microformat
and [Indieweb plugins](https://indieweb.org/WordPress). Generating, receiving,
and displaying comments and [Webmentions](https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/) is
easy.

On the other hand, a static site (this one, at the moment) doesn't provide these
tools. Comments are available via JavaScript using things
like [Disqus](https://disqus.com/) but I'd prefer comments to be mine[^comments]. I know
there has been some movement toward using hooks in Github for comments, but I
also don't want to _have_ to host my site at Github. 

Are there any Indieweb tools or techniques for static sites that I should know about?
