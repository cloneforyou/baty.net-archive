What a beautiful lens! As far as I can tell, this Elmar 9cm was made in 1957. Looks lovely on the M4, don't you think? It still works like butter; so smooth. Hard to believe it was made over 50 years ago.

I don't have anything longer than 50mm in M-mount, so I'd love to try some portraits with it. I expect it to be a bit soft, with a bit of a "vintage" feel to it. Can't wait to run a roll or two past her!
