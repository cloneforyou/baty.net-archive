Gruber commenting on [The Apple Watch Edition’s Upgrade Dilemma][1]:

> The single most frequent question I’ve received this week is how can Apple justify $10,000+ prices for a watch that will be technically outdated in a few years. The simplest answer is that it’s for people who don’t care.

I suppose there are a small but significant number of people who can afford a $10,000 watch. What I find harder to imagine is that many of those people actually "don't care" that their $10,000 watch will rapidly become obsolete. If there's no upgrade path then Apple is selling to a tiny segment of an already small market.
