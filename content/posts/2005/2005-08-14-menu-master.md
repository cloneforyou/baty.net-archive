If, like me, you sometimes wish that your favorite app's keyboard shortcuts were implemented differently, give [Unsanity's Menu Master][1] a try. There are other, free ways to modify menus, but nothing could be simpler than hovering over a menu in any app and pressing your preferred shortcut. Worth the $10.
