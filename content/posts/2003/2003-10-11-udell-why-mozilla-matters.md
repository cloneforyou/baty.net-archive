[Jon Udell's Infoworld article][1] on Mozilla's role among newer "Rich Media" technologies:
  


> Flash still has to prove itself as a tool for business presentation, not just for multimedia eye candy, but I'm convinced that it can.
> 
> The mission of Flash was always to complement the browser, not compete with it. That remains a proper division of labor.
> 
> But as Web services redefine documents, Mozilla, an open and extensible document-handling engine, looks more strategic than ever.</blockquote>
