I take a lot of notes. Having always loved Vim I’m not sure why I’ve never tried [Vimwiki][1]. Vimwiki is "a personal wiki for Vim”. I’ve used it for a couple of weeks now and I like it. I love that I get to write in Vim, and I love that it basically just manages a folder full of plaintext Markdown files<sup id="fnref-3971-markdown"><a href="#fn-3971-markdown" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

Vimwiki supports multiple wikis. I’ve created two wikis, “work” and “personal”. Each becomes its own folder. To switch between them it’s just `,ws` and then enter the number of the blog;

Everything is in Dropbox so notes are synced automatically between machines.

To make links and documents, put the cursor over a word and hit Return twice. You’ll be editing a new document. Save the new document and hit Delete to return to the original. The original word will be surrounded by 2 sets of square brackets ([[ ]]), which indicates a link. The tab key jumps between links.

There’s also a nifty Diary feature. Pressing `,w,w` opens or creates a new diary page for the current day. `,wi` brings up an index of Diary pages:

I didn’t think I’d use the Diary but it’s so handy that I use it regularly.

Anyway, there’s a lot more to Vimwiki. Just do `:help vimwiki` and lose yourself.
