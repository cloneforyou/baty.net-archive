I'm not sure I'd compare an affair exposed by material found after 30 years of being stored in a briefcase to broken security or privacy issues on social media, but I am fascinated by the degree to which Günter documented the thing.

I write in one (paper) journal or another nearly every day, and while I'm not having an affair or doing anything illegal, I _know_ it's likely someone will read them someday. I'm a little careful because of it. Maybe I shouldn't worry so much. I'll just toss them in a briefcase and let the archivists have their fun at my expense later.
