title: Twitter not considered harmful

I read things and wonder about them. For example, is Twitter a distraction that <img class="alignright size-full wp-image-5213" src="/img/2016/05/twitter.png" alt="twitter" width="150" height="150" />I should jettison? Is it making me unhappy?

No.

I'm sure I would not be, as many seem to suggest, "happier" if I ignored Twitter. Twitter is fine. I spend less than an hour a day reading/posting. I follow people I enjoy. I'm endlessly amused by things people post. I get my news and can communicate with people it would be difficult to contact otherwise.

Please stop telling me that Twitter is too distracting. Or worse, harmful.
