Google Analytics is pretty cool, comprehensive and huge. I'm just a little guy with a little site and the whole Analytics thing can be overwhelming. I know there are tons of options for site tracking, but currently I'm in the middle of trying [Clicky][1]. It's small, looks nice and gives simple tracking right down to the individual visitor level. Free for lower-traffic sites. Not much more for others.
