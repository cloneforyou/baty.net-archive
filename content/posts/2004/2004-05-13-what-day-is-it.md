Why do all weblogs have a calendar? You'll notice mine no longer does. I decided to remove it when I realized that with as many weblogs as I read, I have _never_ clicked on one of the calendars &#8211; ever. I finally clicked on mine just to see what it did. Could it be another example of a feature that seemed like a good idea at the time and now we've stopped asking why?
