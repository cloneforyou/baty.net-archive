BBEdit for years. Then Vim for years. Then Emacs for years. In between I&#8217;ve used just about every editor there is. I love them all.

Emacs is everything anyone could ever want in an editor, and more. It&#8217;s the &#8220;more&#8221; part that gets you. At some point this weekend I realized I had spent nearly two hours trying to dial in Emacs window behavior and failed. Even if I had succeeded, it was still two hours I could have been doing something else.

Something else like play with NeoVim, maybe? ðŸ™‚

Oh for crying out loud. I had almost forgotten that I was actually using NeoVim instead of Vim but never completely finished getting things set up. Spent the morning working on it before realizing that I was doing the &#8220;just a few more tweaks and it&#8217;ll be perfect&#8221; thing again. I also wanted to see what the NeoVim GUI landscape was looking like these days so I tried Oni, and VimR and&#8230;

By about 10:00am this morning I had gotten so frustrated with myself that I gave up and decided to use _neither_ Vim nor Emacs for a while. I need a break from myself.

I don&#8217;t edit code much, so what I really want is a place for writing and taking notes. If I keep everything in Markdown I can use any number of apps interchangeably. Right now it&#8217;s looking like some combination of [iA Writer][1] for writing, [BBEdit][2] for text/code editing, [The Archive][3] for research and miscellaneous notes, and [Agenda][4] for project notes.

Everything changes.
