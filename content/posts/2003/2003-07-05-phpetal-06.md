I know I said I was no longer going to work on PHPetal.

I lied.

In response to overwhelming demand (which means I wanted something),

PHPetal now features editing of existing weblog posts.



  * &#8211; Added ability to edit past posts!
  * &#8211; Added toolbar
  * &#8211; Abstracted all HTML generation into separate functions
  * &#8211; A separate configuration file can be used
  * &#8211; Added header with PHPetal logo
  * &#8211; Increased size of title field
  * &#8211; Size of body field is configurable
  * &#8211; Story date is always displayed in date field.&nbsp; This makes it
  
    
  
    easier to modify and reduces errors.
