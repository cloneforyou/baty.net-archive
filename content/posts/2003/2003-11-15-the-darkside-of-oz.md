Went to a [local theater][1] tonight and saw The Darkside of OZ. Take The Wizard of OZ with the volume turned down and play Pink Floyd's _Dark Side of the Moon_ over it. I've always heard there were an awful lot of creepy moments when the music and the movie seemed to sync up perfectly. It's true. Nearly every scene transition was timed to a corresponding song transition. The most dramatic moment was during the magic forest scene. When the song Us and Them says "Up and Down," the Tin Man is pulled off and then crashes to the ground, as if on cue. The movie ends with the words "The time is gone, the song is over. Thought I'd something more to say&#8230;" as the credits roll.
