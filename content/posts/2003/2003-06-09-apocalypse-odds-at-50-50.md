So we've got even odds on surviving some sort of man-made or natural
  

  
disaster wiping out the entire population. At least [according to professor Martin Rees][1].

This comes after reading about a group planning to create a man-made
  

  
black hole which they're "pretty sure" won't just suck in the entire
  

  
planet.

Sell.
