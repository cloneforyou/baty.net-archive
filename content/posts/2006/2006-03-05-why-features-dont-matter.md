Andreas Pfeiffer writes a piece on [Why Features Don't Matter][1] using Apple's iPod as a leading 

example of the soundness of the 80/20 rule, and why deliberately leaving out the other 20% works. 

> Simplicity means getting something done in a minimum number of simple steps. Practically 

anything could be simpler &#8211; but you don't get there by adding features.
