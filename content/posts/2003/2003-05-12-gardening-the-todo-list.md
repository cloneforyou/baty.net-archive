A few folks were somehow inspired by Tantek's [What to do with
  

  
things to do][1] post. One of them was me. Successfully managing my time
  

  
eternally eludes me. [Bryan][2]
  

  
accurately noted today that I spend more time on systems to manage my
  

  
time than I do actually **doing** things. I've got software, pencil and
  

  
paper and a dusty iPaq&#8212;yet I continue to be about half as productive
  

  
as I could be. The goal is to spend roughly the same amount of time
  

  
actually doing stuff, but get more done. So Alex, show us the
  

  
categories&#8230;



  * Grow
  * Restore
  * Maintain
  * Prune
  * Pull

I'll be taking my list of projects, interests and whatnot and putting
  

  
each into one of those categories. I'll start with Pull. Here's one to
  

  
get me started&#8230;

Video Games. Gone. I never play, yet I buy every console that comes out.
  

  
I spend hours on Rotten Tomatoes researching what's fun, and never do
  

  
anything with the information. No more.

There, what's next?&#8230;
