+++

Publishing a blog with WordPress is something I do, not because it's the best option, but because it's the most convenient. What I'd prefer is a fast, secure static site published using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/). I have often moved away from Hugo because it's not convenient enough and I become fatigued.

The ease with which we sacrifice security or quality or privacy for convenience is troubling to me. The Internet of Things, Cloud storage, and using Facebook are all convenient but less secure or durable or private yet we use them anyway. A little extra effort would go a long way.

All this to say that I'm posting here at baty.net again using Hugo. It may not be the most convenient way to blog, but it's what _feels_ right. I'm working on making it more convenient so that there's less reason to leave this time.
