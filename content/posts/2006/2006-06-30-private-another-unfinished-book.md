Sometimes while reading a book, I set it down and for one reason or another never pick it up again. When that happens, it's just an accidentally unfinished book. There are other cases where I deliberately don't finish &#8211; a deliberately unfinished book. This is rarely due to not liking the book, but instead because I've gotten everything I'm going to get from it before it decides the story is over. The latest of these is [Jonathan Strange & Mr. Norrell][1] which is a darn good read. Trouble is, it's 800 pages long and after 400 or so, I've had enough. The beauty is, I've learned to be okay with not finishing a book. One less thing to feel guilty about
