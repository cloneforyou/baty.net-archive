_[Xah Lee on Frames vs. Window in Emacs – Irreal][1]:_

> Lee’s argument, as I understand it, is that switching between windows in a single frame is suboptimal because various Emacs operations will destroy your windows configuration and using something like winner-mode to restore your window configuration is too much trouble.

I&#8217;ve been using a single maximized frame, split into several windows, and I&#8217;m frequently frustrated when I trigger some action which fouls up my carefully constructed layout. I&#8217;ve tried &#8220;layouts&#8221; and &#8220;winner-mode&#8221; and still never feel like I can predict window behavior. Lee&#8217;s suggestion to use two frames, side-by-side, has greatly improved the way I feel using Emacs. He&#8217;s right, it&#8217;s better this way.
