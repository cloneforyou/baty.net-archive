A fella can only care deeply about a limited number of topics at any given time. I tend to jump around quite a lot when it comes to what I'm interested in, so I thought I'd take a snapshot of what interests (and doesn't interest) me right now&#8230;

**Off the Radar**

</p> 

  * CSS Tricks


  * RSS Formats


  * HTML Validation nitpicks


  * Table-less layout


  * Designing my weblog
</ul> 

**On the Radar**

</p> 

  * Getting Things Done (GTD) and other process/systems for task/objective management


  * Web service syndication of **everything**


  * HTML-based application GUI improvements (Javascript/PHP interaction via JSPAN and others)


  * Information Architecture for dummies (Top-down vs. Bottom Up, Navigation and Taxonomy, etc)


  * Unit Testing


  * Tagging vs. Metadata (Like Flickr and del.icio.us as applied in content management systems)


  * Publishing (Improving the quality and quantity of information in this site)


  * Transitional Volatility (Should navigation really be consistent?)


  * Mind-mapping concepts (Useful?)
</ul>
