That may be true, but I don’t understand why. Michael goes on to list some of the advantages of rangefinders. What’s not to like?

For me, rangefinders are superior. The most significant reasons:

  1. I can see the scene outside of the framelines. I like being able to reframe based on what I know is outside the frame rather than by guessing.
  2. Ease of focusing. It has always seemed obvious to me that manually focusing using a rangefinder is much easier. Apparently, some don’t agree. Who knew?

A fortunate side effect of preferring rangefinders is that I can use Leicas. That is _almost_ reason enough.
