title: Seth on inventing a new cell phone

Seth Godin, like pretty much everyone else, wants an iPhone. He also suggests that perhaps Apple hasn't actually, as Mr. Jobs claims, reinvented the phone. He then [presents a list][1] of features that a truly reinvented cellphone would have. Odd thing is, I don't want \*any\* of his suggested features. I think Apple has reinvented the cellphone not by introducing a bunch of new capabilities I may or may not need, but by dramatically improving the way I \*already\* interact with my phone. I hope this turns out to be the case. Reminds me of how I felt about the original iPod.
