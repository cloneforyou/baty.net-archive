Dear too many of you,

I don’t mind that we don’t agree. I’m pretty sure you’re wrong, but I’m willing to listen, so long as you’re willing to discuss things rationally. On the other hand, if you’re only capable of shouting opinions and quoting misguided “data” as facts without also considering (however critically) what I have to say… well then I must say goodbye.

And that’s a shame, because I believe you’re smart, concerned, and capable. Believe it or not, you’ll be missed.

Love,

Jack
