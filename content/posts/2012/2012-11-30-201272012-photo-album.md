Work on the 2012 photo album continues. I say "2012" as if there have been others. There have not been others, but I hope there will be.

Each page contains a photo, printed traditionally in my darkroom, and a hand-written caption. I started with 5&#215;7 prints, which fit nicely along with an index card for the caption. I'm finding I don't like printing that size, so I've switched to 8&#215;10 prints instead. I'm making it up as I go.
