Everything about making a photo with the 4&#215;5 camera is harder. but that doesn't mean it's not _fun_&nbsp;! I've been walking around shooting handheld and zone focusing, which I imagine to be how these "press" cameras were originally used. I have a new level of respect for the folks who were asked to "go and get the shot!" and then handed a case with one these and a stack of film holders.

I have yet to take a photograph I like. One that stands on its own beyond the fact that I took it with my new camera. Here's a photo of the dogs. Again, taken handheld and pre-focused. I framed it using the wildly inaccurate little top-mounted viewfinder. &nbsp;

It's still fun trying.<span style="letter-spacing: normal; ">&nbsp;</span>
