I've been asked many times over recent months, "Have you seen &#8216;Silicon
  
Valley'? No?! Well you best get on that!"

So I watched the first episode, and as I watched, I wondered if I was seeing
  
the same show everyone was raving about. I found the jokes to be the same tired
  
versions of the same nerdy in-jokes from every show about geeks ever. An "I
  
know H.T.M.L." T-shirt? Really. The whole thing played like a mediocre SNL
  
episode.

Maybe later in the series a character I care about will emerge, but based on
  
episode one, they're all basically cardboard cutouts of the same guys (and it's
  
all guys) we've seen before.

Disappointing.
