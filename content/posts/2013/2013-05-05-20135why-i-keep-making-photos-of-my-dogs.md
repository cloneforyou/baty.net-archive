title: Why I keep making photos of my dogs

It seems like I post a photo of one or more of my dogs every week. This is not because I think my dogs are especially interesting or photogenic (although they are that,) but rather it's because I can't think of anything else to photograph.

Some days I walk around the house or neighborhood looking for things that might make interesting photos. Nothing. Then I play with the dogs. They're so energetic and fun that I'm reminded how much I enjoy photographing them. Out comes the camera. Yesterday, it was the Hasseblad, which is the worst camera I own for taking photos anything that moves, but I still love the way it renders.</p>
