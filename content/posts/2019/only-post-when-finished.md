title: Post about after rather than before
---

I would prefer seeing fewer aspirational posts/tweets/etc. I'm not terribly interested that you've _started_ to read a book, but please do let me know how you liked it when you're finished. It's great that you're planning to work out every day, but why tell _me_ that? _Intending_ to regularly write morning pages before breakfast isn't actually writing anything, but I can't wait to hear how it's helped you after you've done it for six months.

Writing aspirational posts can be self-motivating, and I'm guilty of it myself. And of course feel free to write about anything you damn well please. I'm just asking for fewer _before_ and more _after_ posts.
