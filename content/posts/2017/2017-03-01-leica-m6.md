My first Leica was an M6 TTL. I sold it in the mid-2000s and have since
gone through a number of Leica bodies, from an M3 to an M8. For the past
several years I’ve used an M3 and M4. I love them, but I sometimes
missed having a meter in the camera rather than on the camera.

So I bought an M6

It’s the perfect M6 for me. It is one of the last 10 “Classic” M6 bodies
ever produced (1998). It has had the finder optics upgraded to the
flare-free “MP” version. The only framelines displayed are 28, 35, and
50mm. This makes for a bright, beautiful, clutter-free viewfinder.

I chose the M6 “Classic” version because they are generally less
expensive than the newer TTL models, with no real disadvantage. I prefer
the direction of the shutter dial to be the same as my older bodies.

I’ve put one roll through it, and it’s just as smooth and solid as the
M3 and M4. Don’t let the forum trolls convince you otherwise.

As handy as having a built-in meter is, I found that I spent more time
obsessing over the meter’s lights than I did looking at the subject. I
didn’t expect that. I also ended up with a few badly-exposed shots due
to a backlit subject. I would normally have just guessed the exposure.
Instead I listened to the meter. I’ll have to re-learn when to stop
trusting it!

Here are a few shots from the first roll. It’s Tri-X, shot at 1250 ISO
and developed in Diafine, then scanned on the Pakon.
