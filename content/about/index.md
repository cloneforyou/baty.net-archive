## A little about me

{{< image src="jack-about-300x300.jpg" caption="Your host, Jack Baty" width="300" height="300" linked="false" >}}

I was a partner at Fusionary Media from 1995 until we sold the company in May of 2020. I remain there in a consulting role. Fusionary is a terrific digital development studio in Grand Rapids, MI, and if your business needs something built for the web or mobile devices you should üíå [send them a note](mailto:info@fusionary.com).

I blog here at [baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) ‚úíÔ∏è. I write about photography, blogging, analog tools, productivity, software, you name it.

I also write daily, in public, using TiddlyWiki at [Rudimentary Lathe](https://rudimentarylathe.org).

You can email me at [jack@baty.net](mailto:jack@baty.net) ‚úâÔ∏è. I still like receiving email!

I have a few other interests:

**Photography**. I call it ‚Äúphotography‚Äù but it‚Äôs more like ‚Äúcamera collecting.‚Äù I
shoot both film and digital and upload to [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty).

**Analog**. Digital is where we are, but I still enjoy using things like film
cameras, vinyl records, manual typewriters, notebooks, and fountain pens.

See the [Now page](/now) for a list of more specific current interests and projects.

Do not expect consistency.
