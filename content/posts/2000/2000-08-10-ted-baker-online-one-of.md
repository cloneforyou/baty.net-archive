[Ted Baker Online][1]

One of the better examples of an online store created entirely in Flash. Most of the (seemingly required) transitional animations run quickly and then get out of the way. The site also attempts to adhere to some basic UI standards. Some of the text is too small, but for the most part it seems to work pretty well.
