![Is This The Life We Really Want?](/img/2017/roger-waters.jpg)

After nearly 25 years I'd sort of given up on seeing a new solo record from Roger Waters. Then, surprisingly, here comes "Is This the Life We Really Want?" 

He's still angry and writing about the same basic things he has for the last 40 years or so. Fine with me, that's what I've always liked about him. For example, this bit from "Broken Bones":

> When World War II was over  
> Though the slate was never wiped clean  
> We could have picked over them broken bones  
> We could have been free  
>   
> But we chose to adhere to abundance  
> We chose the American Dream  
> And ooo, Mistress Liberty -  
> How we abandoned thee  

And then there's this more current note, from "Picture This":

> Picture a courthouse with no fucking laws  
> Picture a cathouse with no fucking whores  
> Picture a shithouse with no fucking drains  
> Picture a leader with no fucking brains

I really like this record. Some of it is very Floydian, and that's never a bad thing.
