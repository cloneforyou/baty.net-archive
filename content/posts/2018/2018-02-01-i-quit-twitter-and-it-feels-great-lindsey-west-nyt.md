[Lindsey West (NYT)][1]:

> I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge filled with swastikas and Alex Jones’s spittle. Time is finite, and now I have more of it.

And also&#8230;

> Quitting Twitter is just a thing that you can do. I mention it only because there was a time when I didn’t think it was a thing that I could do, and then I did it, and now my life is better.

I&#8217;m still [not leaving Twitter yet][2], but it sure feels as if that day is coming.
