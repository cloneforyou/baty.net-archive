After meaning to read Heinlein's [Stranger in a Strange Land](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/350.Stranger_in_a_Strange_Land) for years I made
the mistake of actually doing it. I tried, but couldn't make it more than about
half-way before giving up.

Does this mean I lose my sci-fi fan club membership?
