This blog (baty.net) goes back to sometime in 2000. I was poking around the
[Internet Archives](https://archive.org/) and ran across jackbaty.com from 2002. It 
looked like this...

I can't explain why those old posts aren't here, but I'm grateful that the Archive 
has copies. Wouldn't want writing like that to disappear, now would we?
