It used to be that weekends were made for Michelob. Now, they're made for software (and a little scotch). This past weekend I had to get my hands dirty with:

</p> 

  * Postfix configuration


  * Courier IMAP/SSL setup


  * pop-before-smtp with Postfix


  * Goofy details of Debian's Apt system


  * Spamassassin


  * Apache/MySQL/PHP5 install


  * Tweaks to a couple of Python scripts


  * CVS Repository move from one server to another


  * ViewCVS.cgi setup


  * Awstats install


  * Importing Blosxom entries into Movable Type


  * And several I've forgotten or would rather not mention
</ul> 

Dealing with a few of the above felt like I was looking for my ass with both hands and a flashlight, but for the most part, it was successful. And for some reason, satisfying and a helluva lotta fun.
