> "Groupware" is all about things like "workflow", which means, "the chairman of the committee has emailed me this checklist, and I'm done with item 3, so I want to check off item 3, so this document must be sent back to my supervisor to approve the fact that item 3 is changing from &#8216;unchecked' to &#8216;checked', and once he does that, it can be directed back to committee for review. Nobody cares about that shit. Nobody you'd want to talk to, anyway."
