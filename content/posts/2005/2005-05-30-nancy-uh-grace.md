I keep waiting for someone at CNN to show up and explain that putting Nancy Grace on prime time, or on the air at all, was just a big practical joke. She's not provocative, she's inflammatory with no shortage of wussy boys (aka Defense Attorneys) to sit there and take it. She's not hard-hitting, she's just a whiny little <del>bitch</del> girl who somehow got to play with the big kids.&nbsp; And since when is it "guilty until proven innocent?" Someone _please_ make her go away.
