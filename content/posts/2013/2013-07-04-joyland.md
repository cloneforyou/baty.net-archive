I always come back to Stephen King whenever I just feel like reading a good story, well-told. Joyland did not disappoint. Joyland is a simple coming-of-age story taking place in and around an aging amusement park. There's murder, mystery, love, ghosts and Speed Graphic cameras. That's everything, right?
