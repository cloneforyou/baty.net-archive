Iain Levison has an interesting take on Drunk Driving and its enforcement 

bq. Most of us think we can have a few beers and drive safely.  You know why we think that?  Because we can!  Only two types of people can't&#8230;teenagers and alcoholics. Teenagers are still learning how to drink and drive, and alcoholics can't control their drinking.  Virtually all drunk driving accidents&#8230;by some accounts as few as 5,000 a year&#8230; are caused by these two groups.  And the remaining ninety percent of us have paid a steep price indeed.
