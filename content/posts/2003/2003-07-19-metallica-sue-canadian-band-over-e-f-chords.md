[Yet another reason][1] to hate Metallica.

_UPDATE_ As Matthew points out, the above story is a hoax. Jimmy Kimmel
  

  
and MSNBC both referred to it as fact, so at least I'm not the only one
  

  
who neglected to check his references. Besides, the fact that so many
  

  
people believed it to be true says something about the sorry state of
  

  
a formerly good-not-great band.
