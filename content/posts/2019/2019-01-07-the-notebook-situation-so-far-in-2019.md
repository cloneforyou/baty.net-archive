My notebook configuration looks nothing like I planned it just a week ago. I had intended to keep things [just like last year][1] but nope.

I bought a couple new [Leuchtturm Bullet Journals][2] and prepped the first of them for the coming year. I was thinking that, as adorable as it is, I&#8217;d leave the [Hobonichi Techo][3] out of rotation.

What&#8217;s actually happening is that I&#8217;ve ended up with an [A4 Moleskine Sketchbook][4] and I&#8217;m using the little Techo _instead of_ the Leuchtturm.

I know, right? It caught me by surprise too.<figure class="wp-block-image">

I bought a little 4&#215;6 photo printer and have been having a ball with it. The big Moleskine gives me room to glue a photo or two to a page and still write stuff around it. I&#8217;m really liking this.

The Techo is so wonderful I just couldn&#8217;t leave it on the sidelines, so I put the Bullet Journal aside instead. I&#8217;m still working out how to make the Techo &#8220;Bullet Journal-esque&#8221; but for now I&#8217;m just pretending it&#8217;s a normal Bullet Journal with a built in calendar. It&#8217;s working fine so far.

Of course I still carry a [Field Notes][5] notebook in the fabulous [Bellroy cover][6], and I don&#8217;t expect that to ever change.

Let&#8217;s see where things are in a couple of months.
