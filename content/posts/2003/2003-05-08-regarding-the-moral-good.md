America gets blasted regularly for its nationalist, unilateral and
  

  
sometimes arrogant attitudes. Many times we deserve it. But a fella has
  

  
to pick a team after all.
  


If Iraq had a shuttle program and lost 7 crew members to an accident
  

  
like that of the Columbia, I'll bet George W. and the American people
  

  
would send our heartfelt condolences, even as we prepare for war. We
  

  
most likely wouldn't cheer and call it "vengeance from God." Just a
  

  
hunch.</p>
