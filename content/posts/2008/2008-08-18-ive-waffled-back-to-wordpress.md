Every six months or so I decide it's time to switch blogging engines. The last time it happened I switched from [Movable Type][1] to [ExpressionEngine][2]. I switched then because I'd heard good things about EE and wanted to try it out somewhere.

This time, I'm going from ExpressionEngine to [WordPress][3]. Why? Because WordPress does pretty much everything anyone needs for a singe author weblog.

I don't want to _design_ my site. WordPress has a zillion or so themes available that I can easily try any time. If I get bored with one, I can easily switch to any other with no fuss.

There are also a huge number of plugins available. If I want to try incorporating some new service like [Friendfeed][4] there's usually a plugin or two already written for it.

ExpressionEngine is about the best thing there is for a large-ish site with custom design requirements and plenty of content to manage. For a simple blog with one guy writing a post or two each week. WordPress leaves very little to be desired.
