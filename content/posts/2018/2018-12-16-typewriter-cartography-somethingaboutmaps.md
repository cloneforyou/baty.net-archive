[Daniel Huffman, somethingaboutmaps][1]:

> In sum: my typewriter is not a precision instrument. This makes it a somewhat uncomfortable-feeling tool for a detail-oriented designer like me. I like being able to zoom in to 64,000% in Illustrator and correct errors that are small enough that no human eye could possibly ever see them. But, thereâ€™s something attractive about the organic messiness of the typewriter.

Another very cool thing to do with a typewriter. I would never have the patience for something like this.
