Enter the M8.

Well almost. I don't have one yet, but it's in the works. But why an M8? Mostly because I want a quality digital option and love my film Ms so much that the M8 seems a natural progression. I ran into a gentleman online who is looking for an M6 and has an M8. Convenient, no? We're going to trade my M6 and cash for his M8. Might be a few weeks before it all happens, but it looks to be a done deal. Can't wait!
