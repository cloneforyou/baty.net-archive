I remain fascinated by wikis in general and [TiddlyWiki][1] in particular. At Fusionary we use [Confluence][2] and [Gitlab wikis][3]. I&#8217;ve had a number of false starts over the years with TiddlyWiki, but a recent realization has helped me take a serious run at it. (Cue sound of several pieces clicking together)

TiddlyWiki is very much like [Tinderbox][4], but in a browser.

They both&#8230;

  * Manage a collection of notes
  * Can automatically collect notes based on various criteria
  * Allow for different visualizations
  * Offer flexible searching options
  * Contain their own macro language
  * Allow for custom metadata for individual notes

While they certainly don&#8217;t offer a 1-to-1 set of features, realizing the similarities has given me an idea for how I can use TiddlyWiki for more than just an occasional experiment. Finally!
