So oddpost, the quirky, fun-loving web-based email service, has released [version 2][1]. Always a sucker for trying everything once, I thought I'd take a look. After clicking "See a Demo", I was redirected to a page (browserReject.html I think it was)

"Oddpost currently requires Internet Explorer 5.0 (or higher) for Windows. If you?d like to see Oddpost released for other browsers or platforms, please drop us a line at . You can click here for more info about Oddpost?s browser compatibility, or here for more general information about our site."

Never mind.
