Eric Meyer [finds yet another reason][1] to love [Adium][2]

  




> Seriously. The entirety of an Adium chat window is an XHTML document that's being dynamically updated via DOM scripting&#8212;all of it pumped through WebKit, of course. In creating a message theme, you define what markup will be used, and write CSS to style it. You can even define variants on your theme by writing additional style sheets.
