One of the few things I find frustrating about the keyboard on my MacBook Pro is the location of the Control key. I \*really\* want to swap the Control and Function keys, but can't find a way to do it. I did find that I can reassign all of the modifier keys using System Preferences->Keyboard and Mouse->Modifier Keys. This isn't too bad, since changing the Caps Lock key to Control works almost as well.&nbsp; Especially handy for all you Vim and Emacs folks.
