Long, but [fascinating piece][1] describing the relatively (no pun) unknown relationship between Einstein and G&ouml;del.

> "G&ouml;del: the union of Einstein and Kafka, had for the first time in human history proved, from the equations of relativity, that time travel was not a philosopher's fantasy but a scientific possibility. Yet again he had somehow contrived, from within the very heart of mathematics, to drop a bomb into the laps of the philosophers. The fallout, however, from this mathematical bomb was even more perilous than that from the incompleteness theorem. G&ouml;del was quick to point out that if we can revisit the past, then it never really "passed." But a time that fails to "pass" is no time at all."
