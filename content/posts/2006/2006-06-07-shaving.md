For the past 6 months or so I've been shaving with as many retro-snooty-geek-hip products as I could find. Merkur safety razor (and blades), badger hair brush and Taylor of Old Bond Street creme. I love them all, especially the creme. I still can't shave daily or my neck looks like a close-range shotgun wound, but when I do shave, it's almost enjoyable. You can keep your silly 4-bladed Fusion nonsense at what, a buck a shave? The Merkur gets just as close, and once you get the hang of it, it's just as easy. If nothing else, get yourself a nice brush and some Taylor of Old Bond Street. I've used the almond and the sandlewood. Both are great. I'd go into more details, but Merlin just posted a [long and very commented post](<http://www.43folders.com/2006/06/07/shaving-tips/>) on this very subject. He claims to like the Fusion better, but he didn't give it long enough. Fun read if you're even remotely interested in a good shave.
