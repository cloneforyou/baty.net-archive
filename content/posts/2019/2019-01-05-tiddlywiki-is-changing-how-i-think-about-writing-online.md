title: TiddlyWiki is changing how I think about writing online

I remain infatuated with [TiddlyWiki][1]. There&#8217;s a certain genius in its design that has captured my imagination.

As an experiment, I started a new wiki and published it at [rudimentarylathe.org][2]. I&#8217;m easily distracted by shiny new things, so I spent a few days learning my way around TiddlyWiki by posting notes and miscellaneous snippets there.

What I&#8217;m finding is that TiddlyWiki is changing how I think about writing online. I don&#8217;t yet understand why, but I suspect it&#8217;s about being able to just throw things at it without feeling like I&#8217;m &#8220;publishing&#8221;. There&#8217;s no RSS feed. The only way anyone else might read what I write there is if I link to it on my &#8220;real&#8221; blog or if someone just stumbles upon it. It feels like a personal, but not private, space.

I think of each &#8220;tiddler&#8221; in my wiki is just a blob of text that is by default unrelated to everything else. I can link and tag them in order to define some semblance of structure, but it&#8217;s not necessary. There are &#8220;Recent&#8221; and &#8220;New&#8221; tabs but otherwise there&#8217;s not really a &#8220;timeline&#8221; of any sort. I&#8217;m currently putting recent entries on the main &#8220;Story&#8221; view but that&#8217;s probably just vestigial behavior from years of a reverse-chronological mindset. It&#8217;s very refreshing!

Any wiki could do most of this, but there&#8217;s something different the way TiddlyWiki goes about it. It feels different, in that it&#8217;s not page-based, but note-based. Or maybe thought-based. I don&#8217;t know what it is exactly, but I&#8217;m digging it.

So, what am I putting at rudimentarylathe.org? I&#8217;m not sure yet. So far it&#8217;s been&#8230;

  * Daily &#8220;Journal&#8221; posts about whatever I&#8217;m thinking about
  * Notes about software that I use or want to use
  * Technical notes on how I solved problems
  * Things I&#8217;ve learned
  * Quotes or interesting bits from things I&#8217;ve read
  * Books I&#8217;ve read
  * ???

I can&#8217;t wait to see where this goes.
