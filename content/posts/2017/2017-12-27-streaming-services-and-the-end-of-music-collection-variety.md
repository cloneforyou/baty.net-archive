> And there‚Äôs simply no room for your 10,000 meticulously tagged MP3s in a world of an always-available 40 million songs.

This is probably true, and it makes me a bit sad, but as Rian van Der Merwe points out on Twitter:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    This article generally rings true, but I think it misses a few trends:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    1) The vinyl resurgence<br />2) The rise of hi-res music platforms like <a href="https://twitter.com/HDtracks?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@HDtracks</a><br />3) Music collection software like <a href="https://twitter.com/roonlabs?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@roonlabs</a>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    But I‚Äôll admit those will probably remain on the fringes. <a href="https://t.co/GhpIaMdxmR">https://t.co/GhpIaMdxmR</a>

And it continues with another probably true statement&#8230;

&nbsp;

> What has also changed is how we consume music, which devices we use to listen to it, how we find and rediscover songs, and how we share them with the world.

But harrumph and balderdash and who‚Äôs this ‚Äúwe‚Äù he‚Äôs referring to? I listen to music almost exclusively on vinyl, so my music collection and collecting isn‚Äôt going anywhere. Get off my lawn, Roettgers! üôÇ
