I've been trying out a new rule lately. It goes like this&#8230; 

**Pick one thing from your list to get done each day and do it \*before\* you check your email.** 

Sure, it's not going to save the world, or your GTD process, but it sure has been working for me. I try to pick something that I'm likely to procrastinate the minute my email inbox has something more "important" in it. Gets it out of the way before I have time to rationalize not doing it. Effective so far.
