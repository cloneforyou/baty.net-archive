Once in a while Emacs and/or Org mode throws me a curveball. Today&#8217;s example is that suddenly I couldn&#8217;t run anything using Org-babel. Trying to do so would result in something like…

> evaluation of this R code block is disabled

I noticed the following error during startup…

> Invalid function: org-babel-header-args-safe-fn

Based on a recommendation in [this Github issue][1] I ran `spacemacs/recompile-elpa`, relaunched Emacs, and all is well.
