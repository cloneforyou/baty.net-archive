My last post about <a
href="https://baty.net/2014/paper-system-for-2014">this year's "paper system"</a> neglected to mention which pen(s)
I use. Most people don't care about pens, but I do.

For me, the right pen to use depends upon what and where I'm writing. There are three "modes" in which I write things down. Each requires a different pen. Ok, "requires" might be a bit ridiculous, but still.

### Jotting things down while out and about
          
If someone at the local pub mentions a great book they just read, I whip out my
trusty Field Notes notebook, which is <em>always</em> at the ready in my back
pocket. Also at the ready is the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.monteverdepens.com/poquitostylus.html">Poquito Stylus from
Montverde</a>. It's so tiny I barely know it's in my pocket. I'm still looking
for something better, though. I prefer this to the usual Fisher Space Pen
because the Space Pen requires two hands to operate. Removing and posting a cap
is not something I want to be doing while trying to capture something quickly.

### Planning, scheduling, and taking notes
          
For nearly all writing tasks, I prefer the <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.montblanc.com/en-us/shop/writing-instruments/meisterstck/black-resin-gold/classique-rollerball-12890.aspx">Montblanc MeisterstÃ¼ck
rollerball</a>. I've had mine for 15 years or so and it's still my favorite.
It's beautiful. I love the way it writes, it feels great to the touch, and fits
my hand perfectly. It's the perfect pen. Seen above with the 2013 <a

### Journaling and letter writing
          
For "serious" writing, nothing beats a nice fountain pen. I've tried dozens of
them and found I prefer the Pelican pens. The one I use is a <a target="_blank"
href="http://www.pelikan.com/pulse/Pulsar/en_US.FWI.displayShop.93681./souveraen-black-blue">SouverÃ¤n
Black-Blue M 400</a>. I fill it with one of any number of fun inks. Writing with
a fountain pen is a tactile and visual pleasure. Shown above with the
