I just can't seem to stop thinking about [Twitter][1]. The idea of a service which keeps everyone informed about my every move seems just silly. Then I remember how absolutely vitally important IM away messages are to Jessica and realize I'm probably wrong again. There's a thing with Twitter that strikes a chord somehow. I don't know why or how most folks will use it, but they will, and the whole thing may end up as something none of us expected.

For me, it's like an extremely lightweight blog with nothing at all attached to it. Wait, I already have one of those&#8230;
