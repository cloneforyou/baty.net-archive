I've watched two movies today. Both are portraits of real-life men fighting mental demons. The first is [Aviator][1] &#8211; big budget, big stars, big director &#8211; horrible movie. The second is [Tarnation][2] &#8211; made by some guy for $218 using iMovie on his Mac &#8211; and infinitely better. I'm going to have trouble shaking both of them, but for entirely different reasons.
