I love this Nikon F3. Sometimes I get a new camera and the shine wears off
quickly (like the Mamiya6 for example). The F3 I still like. I like how it feels
in hand, I like how it looks, and I really like how it performs. I've never felt
as confident with any camera as I do with the F3. Even the Leicas don't inspire
the same confidence. It's a keeper.
