title: Gloating About the Climate
topics: []

As has been pointed out everywhere, July 2016 was the warmest month we've seen,
ever. As a sane person, I understand that climate change is real and remains a
pressing issue.

It's always nice to see evidence of the things we believe, but can we stop
gloating already? First, saying "hottest month" rather than "warmest month"
seems a little excessive. Second, a few warm months on their own don't mean
much. If for some reason it would have been a little cooler last month, climate
deniers would have been all over it and we'd have harumphed and cried
"statistical anomaly!" all the way home.

Ease up a bit, is what I'm saying. Gloating about suggestive evidence is poor form.
