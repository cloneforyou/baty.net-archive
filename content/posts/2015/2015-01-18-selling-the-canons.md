    Canon gear for sale
  </p>
</div>

Eighteen months ago I asked myself if I should [Keep the Nikons or the Canons][1]. Turns out that I've kept most of both. Time to decide, so I'm unloading all the Canon gear.

This wasn't an easy decision, mostly due to the EOS-1v, which I _love_. The 1D Mark III is also terrific, and would be perfect for any "serious" work I might do. Trouble is, I don't do any serious work. I just snap pictures, and the Fuji X-T1 is totally capable of handling anything I might want to shoot digitally. Finally, a decision!

Here's what's for sale:

  * Canon 1d Mark III $750
  * Canon EOS 1v 35mm Camera $350
  * Canon Canon EF 24-105 mm F/4 L IS USM Lens: $700
  * Canon 50mm 1.8D: $100
  * Canon 50mm EF 1.4 II: $100 (autofocus not working)
  * Canon Speedlight 580EX II $250
