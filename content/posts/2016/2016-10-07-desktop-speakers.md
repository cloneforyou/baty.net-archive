I have a pretty decent sound system in my home office, but I rarely listen to
it. Instead, I find myself just playing music through the iMac. It occurred to
me that it could be because the stereo's speakers are situated _behind_ me.
Maybe that's what causes my "listener fatigue".

To test this theory, I ordered a pair
of [Audioengine A2+](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DQMJE7E) powered
desktop speakers and it's made all the difference.

I can now listen to music all day while sitting at my desk and never tire of it.
