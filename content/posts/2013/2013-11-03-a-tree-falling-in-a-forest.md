            For a time I thought I wanted to "build an audience" for this blog. I thought that if I kept to one topic, photography, more people might be interested in stopping by here regularly. That never happened, probably because I don't care enough about "followers". Good thing, since I get almost zero traffic here. That's OK.

            I've always used this space as a place to get things off my chest or share things I'm interested in, whatever the topic. There's too much pressure on Twitter or Facebook to be interesting or clever or social. This is more like a quiet place where I can talk to myself. I like it that way.

            So,  jackbaty.com will go back to being all over the map. I'm going to try keeping my <a href="http://jackbaty.tumblr.com">tumblr blog</a> specifically about photography. I'll cross-post anything I think might be useful in both places. Yes, this is the opposite of my original plan. So be it.
