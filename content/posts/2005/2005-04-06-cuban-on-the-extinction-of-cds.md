I now buy all of my music on CD. For a while iTunes was cool and buying music with one click was fun, but then Apple started doing that change the rule thing. Besides, used CDs are cheaper than buying one from Apple and I can rip them into any format I choose and do whatever I like with them. This is good.

Mark Cuban [explains why][1] I don't have much more time to do things this way. A quote&#8230;

Although I don't feel quite so bad since I'm still listening to vinyl too.
