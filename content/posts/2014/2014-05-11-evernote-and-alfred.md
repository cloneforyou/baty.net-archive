For some reason, I can never completely give up Evernote, so I'm always looking for ways to improve the experience. While browsing around the [Packal][1] site looking for [Alfred][2] workflows, I spotted the [Evernote Workflow][3], which does a pretty good job of letting me search and create notes in Evernote right from Alfred.

![Evernote Workflow][4]

From the workflow description:

**Keywords available**

  * **ens** to search in every note field
  * **ens** @ to search in a selected notebook
  * **ens** # to search notes with a selected tags

> You can use **ent** (search in titles only) or **enr** (search in reminders) or **entodo** (search to-do notes) or **enrec** (search notes updated within a week) or **enu** (search notes with a source URL) instead of **ens**.
