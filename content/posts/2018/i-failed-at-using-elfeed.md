+++

Since I'm in Emacs most of the time anyway, I thought it would be useful to use [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) for reading RSS feeds.

It didn't work out.

I couldn't make heads or tails out of what Elfeed was doing with windows. I felt
even more helpless with window management than usual. I often have an Emacs
frame in full-screen, split into two or three columns. With Elfeed's feed list
in the left of three columns, new entries would open in the far right column. Weird and
unexpected. Starting with two columns, the right window is so wide that it makes
reading text difficult. I couldn't figure out how to manage any of this.

I couldn't get the article date to display in the feed list. All of the
screenshots I've seen of Elfeed show the date. There's a bunch of settings for
the date _format_ but I couldn't find anything about including it.

The feed list format goes all kittywampus seemingly at random. Sometimes it
looks like a plain text list of titles. As I read each article, its entry
reformats itself with the proper columns and faces. I cannot figure out how to
fix it.

I couldn't get the Elfeed database to sync consistently. Putting the database in
a synced folder didn't seem to work. I'm sure I'm doing something wrong or
missing a step. I can't seem to figure out when Elfeed updated the database, and
I don't want to include a bunch of config hacks to force the issue.

Beyond my technical failings, I've learned that reading feeds is, for me, a "lean
back in the chair and click things" activity. With Elfeed, I need to be sitting
upright with my hands on the keyboard and I guess I'm too lazy for that.

I'm once again using [Feedbin](http://feedbin.com) for managing and reading RSS
feeds. I started using Feedbin as a way to manage and sync my subscriptions, but
planned to actually read things in [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) but never
got to the second part. I just use the web UI for now and it's not bad at all.
