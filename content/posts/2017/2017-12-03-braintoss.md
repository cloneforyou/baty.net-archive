I've been using [Braintoss](https://braintoss.com) for only a couple of days and it has already found a place on my iPhone's dock.

Braintoss lets me quickly write a note, capture a photo, or record a voice message and have it immediately processed and sent to my email inbox. It's simple and effective. It's unlikely to replace my paper pocket notebook but it's a handy alternative.
