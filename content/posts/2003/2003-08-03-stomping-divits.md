Saw my first polo match today. I've never ridden a horse without falling off, so I can only imagine the skill it takes to ride that fast while hitting a little ball with a stick. The best part was stomping the divits between chukkers 3 and 4, which means we all got to run around the field and replace bits of sod torn up during the match.
