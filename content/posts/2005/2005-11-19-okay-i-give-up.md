So my little experiment with a Tumblelog was fun. However, it seems it is (was) pretty much universally disliked. Or I should say that folks enjoyed it less than my "normal" blog. Tell ya what I'm gonna do. I'm going to abandon the tumblelog and continue posting here. There, happy now?! See you soon.
