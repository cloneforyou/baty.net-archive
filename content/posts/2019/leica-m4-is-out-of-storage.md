Finally, I've gotten my beloved Leica M4 out of storage. It's been in
a case in my basement since last year's move and that's a shame.

The camera was made in 1966 and I bought it in 2009. It's seen regular, if sporadic, use since
then. I think it's beautiful, and I especially like that it has the M3-style
levers.

I have the tiny and terrific Voightlander 35mm Color Skopar on it. That lens is almost _too_ small, but it makes fine images and was inexpensive.

It feels good to be using this setup again. I'll run a few rolls through it and see if I still become fatigued shooting with no meter at all.
