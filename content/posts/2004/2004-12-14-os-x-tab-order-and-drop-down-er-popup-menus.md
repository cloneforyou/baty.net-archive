Nitpick: Is there a way to (globally) make popup menus in OS X part of the tab order? How many times a day should I have to stop typing while filling in one form or another just to grab the mouse and manipulate a popup menu? Tab-type-tab-type is a pretty good flow that I wish would remain uninterrupted.
