Books about gods messing with humans are always fun. Books about _stories_ about gods messing with humans are even more fun. "_[The Sugar Frosted Nutsack][1]_" is such a book. Mark Leyner is a showy genius and this book is one of those in which you can "see the writing." Some people dislike that. I'm not one of those people. When the writing is this much fun, I want to see it all.
