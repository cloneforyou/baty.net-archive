After about a month of (very) beginner Kung Fu lessons, I'm hooked. My hips hurt and I sweat more than anyone in the class, but I'm having a ball for some reason. It's pretty suprising considering that I'm a sedentary beast and typically dislike things that are _good_ for me. I've even got Jessica going now. After her second class she says it's "a lot of fun." Imagine that. From the [school's web site][1] &#8230;

Training includes an internal breathing form called Iron Wire Fist, which is used to strengthen muscles, organs and bones. Additionally, there are over eighteen weapons sets including batons, the staff, spear, three sectional staff, wind sword, whip chain and double edge straight sword."
