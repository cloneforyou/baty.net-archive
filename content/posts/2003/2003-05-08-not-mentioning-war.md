You may have noticed, or maybe not, but I'm not planning on talking about the war (or should I say **potential** war) with Iraq or anyone else. It's very much on my mind, but do you think I really have anything useful to add to the debate? I didn't think so. Funny, but most bloggers I read seem to think that suddenly everyone is interested in hearing their political opinion. Let's get back on topic and leave warblogging to the warbloggers.
