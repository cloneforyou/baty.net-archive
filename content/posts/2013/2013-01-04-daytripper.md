            Comics haven't been my thing, yet so many people I respect and admire seem to love them. It's for that reason that I keep trying. Daytripper was recommended to me by several friends and I read it straight through. What I think I was supposed to feel was that it's important to live every moment to its fullest. What I felt instead was the dreadful thought that I could die at any moment. I enjoyed the read, but it was a bit of a downer for me. I'll return to it some day and my hunch is that I'll like it more.
