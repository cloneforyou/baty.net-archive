![aberlour-abunadh-cask-strength.jpg][1]

I'm nowhere near the level of a whisky snob but I sure do love a good single malt. My current favorite is Aberlour a'bunadh. It's a cask strength whisky, meaning no water is added before bottling, leaving a powerful 59.6% alcohol content. Sipping is required. Cask strength also leaves the decision of how much water to add, if any, up to the drinker. I add about a half teaspoon per dram. I'll let the distillery describe it&#8230;

**Nose**

An intoxicating aroma of mixed spices, praline and spiced orange, harmonising with rich, deep notes of Oloroso sherry.

**Taste**

Orange, black cherries, dried fruit and ginger, spiked with dark bitter chocolate and enriched with sherry and oak. Full-bodied and creamy.

**Finish**

Robust and intense, with bitter-sweet notes of exotic spices, dark chocolate and oak.

Whatever. All I know is that it's delicious and has the most beautiful color.
