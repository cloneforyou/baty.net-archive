I like the idea of [Letter.wiki](https://letter.wiki/conversations).

> Letter is a platform for thoughtful conversation.

One concern is that even though they are ostensibly 1:1 conversations, it is impossible to write as if there's no audience other than the recipient, as there is with, say, an actual letter. The unavoidable desire to sound smart in front of the bystanders contains too large an opportunity to spoil the conversation.
