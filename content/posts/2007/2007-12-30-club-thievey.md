Mike Lee wants to buy you a (toy) Lemur. Just donate $100 (or more of course) to the [Madagascar Fauna Group][1] and he'll do just that. I (technically, Fusionary) just donated, mostly because Mike [asked so damn nicely][2]. And this, from [another post][3], clinched it&#8230;

> Seriously, if I have to read another story about how David Pogue ate a burrito, and it gave him gas, and when he farted it sounded kind of like “subnotebook” from a so-called news organization that didn’t notice that, right now, the Mac community and and its developers are making a huge fucking difference in Madagascar, I’m going to punch someone in the balls. 

So check out [Club Thievey][4]. And donate if the mood strikes you.
