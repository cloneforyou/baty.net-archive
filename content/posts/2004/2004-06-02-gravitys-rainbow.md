I'm not smart enough to understand the books I'm interested in reading. I recently finished _Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity_ by David Foster Wallace. Neat, but honestly I only understood about half of it, and I'm unsure which half.

A book I've started several times but could never get rolling with is Thomas Pynchon's _Gravity's Rainbow_. I can tell by the way he practically throws words _at_ me that it's probably a very good read. But although I hesitate to admit it, I just didn't get it. So in a desparate attempt to actually finish it, I [ordered][1] _A "Gravity's Rainbow" Companion: Sources and Contexts for Pynchon's Novel_ with the hope that cheating will help.
