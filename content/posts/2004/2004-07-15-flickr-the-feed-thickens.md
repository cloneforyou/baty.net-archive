So far, [Flickr][1] rocks. It's still officially in beta, and things change/improve almost daily. The site is a great combination of easy to use and geek-friendly. The developers are focused on all the right things. There seems to be a core set of ideals that touch on things like standards-compliance, ease of use, extensibility, accessibility and other goodies.

They've just teamed up with [FeedBurner][2] to offer feed splicing, which is a way to patch together your Flickr photos with your weblog RSS feed.&nbsp; See the [Flickr blog entry][3].

I'd never heard of FeedBurner. They basically take your feed and tweak it in all sorts of configurable ways. As an example, over on your right is a FeedBurner icon which links my "burned" feed. It automatically chooses the format (RSS/Atom, etc) based on the parser and can do all kinds of wonderful things I've yet to discover.

They are both pre-release products that will be well worth watching.
