Added a new blog for random notes, mostly as an excuse to try blogging with fargo.io.

The new blog is at [notes.baty.net][1]. It's not really a blog as much as a place to keep random thing that pop into my head during the day. Things either too long or too snarky or too stupid for Twitter.

UPDATE: See [Changes at Small Picture][2].
