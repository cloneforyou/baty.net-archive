title: Setapp or Not?

As I was reviewing my growing list of software subscriptions, I remembered [Setapp][1]. I&#8217;ve been subscribed to Setapp since launch. I like the idea of &#8220;Netflix but for apps&#8221;. Access to a large and growing list of useful apps for ten bucks a month is pretty great.

But is it worth it to me? Let&#8217;s see.

**Apps I regularly use**

  * Forklift
  * Marked
  * Ulysses
  * BusyCal
  * Renamer
  * CleanMyMac
  * iStat Menus
  * Permute
  * TaskPaper
  * Sip
  * Flume
  * Squash
  * Timing

**Apps I occasionally or might use**

  * Aeon Timeline
  * Bartender
  * BetterTouchTool
  * Declutter
  * Downie
  * Gemini
  * Gifox
  * Merlin Project Express
  * Netspot
  * NotePlan
  * Numi
  * Paw
  * Screens
  * WiFi Explorer

I&#8217;d say that settles it. Nearly 30 apps I either use often or only need occasionally for $10 a month makes it a no-brainer. I don&#8217;t even need to do the math on how much just the regularly-used apps would cost me. Also, Setapp regularly adds new apps, so the value continues to increase over time.
