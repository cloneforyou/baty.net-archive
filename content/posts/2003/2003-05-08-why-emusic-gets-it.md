title: Why EMusic gets it

Lots of opinions out there on the new Apple music service. Personally,
  

  
I think .99 per song won't be cheap enough to pull people away from
  

  
the free P2P networks, especially since the files are riddled with
  

  
DRM. I'll stick with eMusic, primarily for the reasons listed [here][1]. Of course,
  

  
not having an OS X Mac handy makes that decision easier.
