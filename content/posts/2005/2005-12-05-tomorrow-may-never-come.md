> The truth is simple. People confuse what is urgent with what is important; what is pressing today with what is pressing in terms of their whole life. A task stands before you and shouts for your attention because it's here, now, and must be done by tomorrow. So you set aside far more important activities and choices because they're not urgent. You can do them tomorrow, no matter. Only that tomorrow never comes."
