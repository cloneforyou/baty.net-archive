My resolutions for 2005 are not yet formalized, which is something I plan to do sometime this year. I do, however, have a few things that I'd like to accomplish. In the interest of making myself accountable for those things I thought I'd jot them down here. The fear of public ridicule if I fail is a pretty good motivator.

The first is to read at least 12 books this year. I'll rephrase that &#8211; to _finish_ at least 12 books. I start them frequently and buy them even more so. The first few are to be books that I've already begun.

I'm starting with [Once Upon a Number][1] by John Allen Paulos.
