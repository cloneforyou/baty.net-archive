Finally, the new [joecartoon.com][1] has launched. All new design, Rails CMS, custom Flash media player, videos, games and more. Joe's stuff has been cracking me up since he was still doing his thing in our building a number of years ago. It was a pleasure to be involved with the development of the new site. 

This is probably the highest-traffic site I've been involved in deploying. In this case, nearly everything is page-cached which helps a great deal. Lots of benchmarking, asset management and guesswork. There's much tweaking to do yet, but it's a great start and running nicely so far. 

Check it out, it's fun
