An interesting piece about [jazz in the digital age][1] discusses the danger of music distribution without the original album notes, artwork, etc.

I was thinking along these same lines earlier in the week during a brief musical-nostalgia-fest on the iTunes Music Store. After lamenting the recent Will Smith-led assassination of everything good about Asimov's classic robot stories, I was reminded of one of my favorite records while growing up: _I, Robot_ by the Alan Parson's Project.

Much of the music I listened to in the 70s consisted of things like Rush's _2112_, _The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway_ by Genesis, the afore-mentioned Alan Parson's Project and just about anything by Pink Floyd. Many of these were progressive rock **albums**, entire units of music that belong together. While online music services make it easy to grab a few favorite tunes, it also makes it easy to destroy a perfectly good song by removing it from its rightful place among the rest of the music.

I feel a little sorry for today's teens. One of the great pleasures of those days was carefully tearing the plastic off a new album and spending the next few hours reading every word of the liner notes while listening to it over and over again. Even if I did have to get up every 20 minutes or so to turn the record it over.

Sure, the internet has gobs more information on any and every artist/song/whatever, but the rarity and and tangibility of those liner notes and album covers make them seem somehow more special.

Oh, and the music was better.
