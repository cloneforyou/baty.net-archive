Well thank God for the design talent at [work][1], because there's no way I could handle the actual "design" part of web design. I spent about two hours today staring at my site, hating it and thinking I should come up with something better. What did I end up with? Well, I stole that orange color and scurried home mumbling something about "no-talent, design-deficient idea-less wanker&#8230;"

<ins>Update: No more orange. Gone by popular demand.</ins>
