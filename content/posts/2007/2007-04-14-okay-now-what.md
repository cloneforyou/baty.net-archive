So I moved back to [WordPress][1], whatuvit? I have enough Rails apps to keep running without having to worry about my blog. Besides, there's no question that the WordPress community is about as big as they get. Now I can post with [MarsEdit][2], interact with [Twitter][3] and change themes every 6 hours and never run out of new ones. 

Besides, you're all using RSS anyway.
