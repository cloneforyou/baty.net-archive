title: Expired Delta 3200

I'm trying to use up a bunch of expired film in my freezer, so I put a roll of Delta 3200 (exp 2011) through the Hasselblad. Just a few quick shots of Josie around the house. This one isn't helped by the dirty window glass I shot through, but she still looks cute and the film worked fine.
