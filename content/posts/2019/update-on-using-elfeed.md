title: Update on using Elfeed
---

It turns out that most of the problems I wrote about in [I Failed at Using Elfeed as My RSS Reader](https://www.baty.net/2018/i-failed-at-using-elfeed-as-my-rss-reader/) were due to the "improvements" introduced by the [elfeed-goodies package](https://github.com/algernon/elfeed-goodies). Removing that package made Elfeed behave as I'd expect, and now I'm reading feeds in Emacs again :)

This isn't likely to replace [NetNewsWire](https://ranchero.com/netnewswire/) for the majority of my read-for-pleasure feeds, but it's quite nice for cranking through more "transactional" feeds.
