title: Starting from scratch on the SE
url: /2017/176/

I&#8217;ve been running the iOS 11 betas on my iPhone SE for a while now. I installed the GM a week ago and I&#8217;m still having weird problems. Can&#8217;t install new apps. Update checks fail. Won&#8217;t update my watch. So I just clicked &#8220;Restore&#8221; after deleting the beta profile. Starting from scratch. If this fails I guess I&#8217;ll have to buy one of the new phones. :).
