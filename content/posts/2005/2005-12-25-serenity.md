![Serenity Movie](/files/serenity.jpg) 

[Serenity](<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/serenity/>) is a surprisingly good science fiction film based on Joss Whedon's ill-fated Firefly television series. Don't let its T.V. roots stop you. Serenity is better than all three recent Star Wars movies. It's funny, the dialog is reasonably fresh, and there's actually a fair amount of character development. Oh, and a hovercraft chase &#8211; naturally.
