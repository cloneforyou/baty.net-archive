title: Get a better rant (or my rant on ranting)

I have read Jeremy Zawodny's blog for quite a long time.&nbsp; He's tight with Yahoo, knows really everything there is to know about MySQL, and is generally interesting. On the other hand, there's [his rant about Apple and iTunes][1], which starts out off the tracks and just gets worse. You can read it if you wish, but the gist is that he upgraded iTunes (on XP) and somehow the process missed some of his songs. Here's how the whole thing sounds&#8230; "I ran and old version of iTunes&#8230;waaah, waaah&#8230; something broke&#8230;waaah, fuck you apple&#8230;waaah&#8230;" and so on. He clearly states that it's going to be a rant, and that seems fair, but what's the point, really?

Rants, unless very well written (and few are), are seldom more than simply bitching for the sake of hearing oneself bitch. I suppose that could help the ranting person in some way, but I don't want to hear it. I suppose if you _want_ an audience of unfulfilled entitlement society crybabies shouting "Yeah, me too!" then go ahead. Otherwise, do what my mother always suggested: If you don't have anything good to say, shutthefuckup.

(Hey, that _does_ feel kinda good, though.)
