<span class="drop_cap">S</span>o there's this new Dell "Mini 9":http://www.dell.com/mini thing, another tiny, net-centric laptop. Neat! Tell me more! Sorry I asked. Found the following video of one of guys on the product team introducing me to this exciting new product.



Well Mr. Pitstick, Senior Manager of Global whatever, when introducing a new product, using video no less, it might be a good idea to actually show it to me.

I swear he just holds in casually in his hand for like 5 minutes while droning on and on about Usage Cases, Value Propositions, Componentry and whatever. Bored to tears.
