[.@Twitter. Who Do You Think You Are? &#8211; NYTimes.com][1]

> It’s utterly insane that you still need to put a period before a person’s Twitter handle, such as “.@twitter,” if you want everyone to see it. Could you imagine Facebook doing that? Twitter still uses “favorite” instead of the more universal “like.” And Twitter still expects people to use Boolean search commands.

Bilton describes all of the best things about Twitter as if they’re flaws.
