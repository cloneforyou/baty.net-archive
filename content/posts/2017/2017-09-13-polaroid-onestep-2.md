Polaroid (really The Impossible Project) Â has a new instant camera: The [Polaroid OneStep 2][1]. You bet I pre-ordered one!

Coincidentally, I sent my SX-70 out for repair earlier this week, so I&#8217;ll soon be able to shoot instant film with either my original from the 1970s or the brand new one. Film truly is not dead yet.
