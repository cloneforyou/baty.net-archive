I found a box of color film for the SX-70 from the early days of The Impossible Project so I thought Iâ€™d shoot a few and see what happened. Not much happened. The coating must have gotten wonky and the shots came out either blank or mostly blank. Oh well, unpredictable results are part of the fun of shooting old film in old cameras.
