> Working in the darkroom made me a far better, sharper photographer in the field. I could no longer be sloppy, make a good scan and make a workable digital print. Making a good darkroom print starts with a good negative, so you have to be more focused and more on your game. I also love the reality of never being able to make two prints the same, meaning that each and every print is a unique object, the complete opposite of digital printing. But ultimately my decision to go back in the dark is spurred by the unfortunate reality that I have absolutely no feeling toward machine made inkjet prints.

Yes, that.
