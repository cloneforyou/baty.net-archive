Naturally, given my disdain for anything remotely Miley Cyrus, I was ready to dismiss her cover of "Babe, I'm Gonna Leave You" (originally by Joan Baez and made famous by Led Zeppelin).

I mean, how _dare_ she!?

Cyrus is no Plant, but she plays it true to the original and it's better than I expected. So, huh.
