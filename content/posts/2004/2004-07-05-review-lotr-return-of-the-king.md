The final [Lord of the Rings][1] sucked. I may be the only person alive who thought so, but I want my 3 hours, 21 minutes back right now!

**Synopsis:**

**Scene One**: Two kids and an annoying CG critter who squeaks nothing but the word "precious" walk around on rocks and argue over which one of them is the bad guy.

**Scene Two**: A huge battle sequence between two armies of unknown origin.

Alternate between those two scenes for three hours.

Then, show a few kids, aka "hobbits" jumping up and down on a bed and then going home to their little Dr. Suess houses.

Whatever.
