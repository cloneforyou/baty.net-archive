A year or two ago, many bloggers would list the books they were reading somewhere on their blogs, usually near a blogroll or other typical weblog whathaveyou. This practice seems to have fallen out of favor. It's a shame, because that was a great way of discovering new things to read. In an effort to revive the practice, I've decided to list recently, currently or about to be read books. You'll find the list over there on the left somewhere.

And please, if you know of something that should be there but isn't post a comment or [email me][1] and let me know.
