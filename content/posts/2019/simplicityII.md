[Bastian Allgeier](https://bastianallgeier.com/notes/simplicity-part-2):

> Whenever there's no package.json I know it's going to be a good day. Whenever there's one, Pandora is coming along the way with her fucking box.

I'm happy that I get to work with some great developers so that I don't have to be one myself. I couldn't handle modern web development.
