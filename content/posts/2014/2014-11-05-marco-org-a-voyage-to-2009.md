[A Voyage to 2009][1]:

> The ideal Kindle would have [hardware page-turn, Home, and Menu buttons][2] _and_ a touch screen for UI navigation, selection, and text entry.
> 
> The [hidden, error-prone touch zones][3] would be optional and off by default, since the hardware buttons would remove the need. 

(Via [Marco.org][4])

These are exactly what I’d like to see.

On the other hand, I don’t mind the pseudo buttons. I like the Voyage more than Marco does, and I’m not as ready to write Amazon off, but a better device would be welcome. For now though, the Kindle Voyage is the only viable e-reader option, and it’s a pretty good one.
