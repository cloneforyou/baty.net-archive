{{< image src="eddie.jpg" caption="My unfinished painting of Iron Maidens Eddie" >}}




I started this painting of Iron Maiden’s “Eddie” from their “Killers” album cover in 1981 and have yet to finish it. I’m guessing I never will, but it remains in my closet, just in case. I think I was afraid of painting his hair so I’ve put it off for going on 40 years and counting.
