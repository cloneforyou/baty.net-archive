I followed a [link to a Podcast](http://dobyfriday.com/17) because it was about [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) and included thoughts by Merlin Mann. Merlin was involved with the initial development of OmniFocus and has been a GTD/productivity nut forever so his opinion is valuable to me. Eager to hear his take on Todoist, I started listening to the podcast.

They got to the part about Todoist, but it took nearly _forty minutes_! Good lord, why does every podcast take so long getting to the damn point?
