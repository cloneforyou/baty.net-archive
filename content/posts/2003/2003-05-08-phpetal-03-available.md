I've got an update to [PHPetal][1] available for [download here][2]. Guess we'll call it version 0.3.

Changes are:
  


  * &#8211; Allows posting to nested categories
  * &#8211; Added setting for default file suffix
  * &#8211; Changed posting form title to something less annoying

Thanks to [Tony Williams][3] for sending me a patch for allowing posts to nested categories.
