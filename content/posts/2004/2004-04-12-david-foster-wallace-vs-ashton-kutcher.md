Jessica and I, sitting on the plane en route from West Palm Beach to Cincinnati. I'm reading David Foster Wallace's _Everything and More. A Compact History of Infinity_ while she thumbs through the latest issue of _Tiger Beat_ magazine. There's a story there. Not sure how it reads, but I can't wait to see how it ends.
