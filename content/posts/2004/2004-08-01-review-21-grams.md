In [21 Grams][1], Sean Penn, Benicio Del Toro and Naomi Watts are fantastic. I'd not rented it because I thought it was just another Traffic clone. Turns out it has very little to do with drugs. Just a few people dealing with life and death in an intense, twisted story, told in a sort of disjointed, time-fractured puzzle.

Thumbs up.
