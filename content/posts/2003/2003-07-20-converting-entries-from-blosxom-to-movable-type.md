title: Converting entries from blosxom to Movable type

I had several hundred weblog entries formatted for use in blosxom, and couldn't find any converters for creating a movable type import file from them. Being the resourceful fellow that I am, I wrote my own. It's a Python script that is called from within the directory of story files. It creates a single text file, mtimport, for importing into MT. I know very little Python, but it worked. If you're feeling brave, you can grab a copy of it for yourself, [blosxom2mt.py][1]
