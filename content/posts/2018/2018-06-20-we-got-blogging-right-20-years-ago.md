I&#8217;m feeling especially nostalgic for the Good Old Days of Bloggingâ„¢. Looking at my blog from 2003 makes me think we got blogging right early on.

That&#8217;s one of the earliest captures of my blog that I could find on [archive.org][1]. I miss it. Look at that sidebar with a blogroll and XML icon. &#8220;Powered by blosxom&#8221;! I may even adjust my current theme to be a bit more mid-2000-ey, just for kicks.
