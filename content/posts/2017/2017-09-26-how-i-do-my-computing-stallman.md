title: How I do my Computing â€“ Stallman

[Richard Stallman][1]:

> I edit the pages on this site with Emacs also, although volunteer helpers install the political notes and urgent notes. I have no experience with other ways of maintaining web sites. In principle I would be glad to know about other ways, but learning about them is low priority for me and I have other things to do.

I read Stallman&#8217;s notes about his processes once in a while as an insanity check. It reminds me how much we&#8217;ve succumbed to the temptations of always improving the way we do things. It also reminds me how difficult it is to resist those improvements. Gotta give RMS credit for sticktoitiveness.
