I'd have never guessed that Fred Rogers was an early, vocal proponent of fair use rights. Here's an excerpt from his testimony during the Sony Betamax trial.



> "Some public stations, as well as commercial stations, program the &#8216;Neighborhood' at hours when some children cannot use it. . . . I have always felt that with the advent of all of this new technology that allows people to tape the &#8216;Neighborhood' off-the-air, and I'm speaking for the &#8216;Neighborhood' because that's what I produce, that they then become much more active in the programming of their family's television life. Very frankly, I am opposed to people being programmed by others. My whole approach in broadcasting has always been &#8216;You are an important person just the way you are. You can make healthy decisions.' Maybe I'm going on too long, but I just feel that anything that allows a person to be more active in the control of his or her life, in a healthy way, is important."
