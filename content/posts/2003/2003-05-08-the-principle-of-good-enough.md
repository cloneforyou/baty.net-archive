I worry that I'm often seen as too willing to compromise on projects,
  

  
saying "Ship it! It's good enough!" This might seem like a tendency
  

  
toward the mediocre, but it's not. Sometimes, good enough is just
  

  
that, and we can make it better tomorrow. [Doc Searls][1], with credit to [David Sifry][2] refers to this as
  

  
POGE: The Principle of Good Enough.

Later, he says:

I think I could accept "Triumphantly adequate," were it just a step
  

  
along the way to something better.
