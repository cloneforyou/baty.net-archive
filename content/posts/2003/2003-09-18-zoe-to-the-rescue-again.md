I sometimes almost forget that [ZOE][1] is running on my machine, grabbing stuff, categorizing and cross-referencing things I'm not even thinking about. Today I accidentally deleted a Movable Type post. No problem, I just did a quick search using ZOE and found the entry. A copy/paste/publish later and we're back to normal. It's also been known to save me when I get a litte aggressive with the delete key while reading email.
