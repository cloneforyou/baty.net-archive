$290 million is a lot of money, but the odds of winning are somewhere in the neighborhood of 135 million-to-1. Repeat after me&#8230; **You Will Not Win!**. Nor will I or quite probably anyone we know.

I have just as much fun thinking about winning without playing as I would if I bought a ticket. The odds are essentially the same anyway.

Oh, and if anyone I know _does_ win, forget I said anything.
