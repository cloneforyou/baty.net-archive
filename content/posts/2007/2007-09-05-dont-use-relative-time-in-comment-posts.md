If you have a blog, and allow comments, please do me a favor. Include the real date and time with each comment. I'm too lazy to do the math when the comment says "Anonymous Dufus said, 241 days later&#8230;" 

241 days later than _what_? Now I've got to scroll all the way back up and find the date of the original post and then start counting. By then I'm terribly confused and annoyed. Let's stick with just a date, m'kay?
