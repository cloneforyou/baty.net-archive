It never had occured to me 

The way it has to be 

is never never only what it should be 

Some this some that some other 

kid forgets his mother 

then take the wasted lives of one another 

It never seemed I never saw 

true light shine out and on and all 

the things that come up/down before the fall 

The growth the life before the rise 

But once I looked into those eyes 

Not knowing what could crawl out of the skies 

Peaks first then ebbs it shrinks and grows 

Aroma smelled not with the nose 

A thorn has fallen from life's withered rose 

Once dust once ash a Phoenix came 

from out of pointed angry blame 

And nothing else has ever done the same 

Over up and once thought dead 

A voice that rang in angels' heads 

Now sings a song of loneliness instead 

Not gone not here not anywhere 

A madnes permeates the air 

Strips all and one and thing completely bare 

And spoken with a raspy breath 

While looking down upon the earth 

"All the meek inherit now is death."
