Garry Winogrand didn't just talk about being a street photographer. He didn't dream about it while his camera grew old in his bag. Winogrand **was** a street photographer &#8211; and a damn good one. Some notable examples&#8230;

You'll find a [nice article about him here][1]. From the article&#8230;
