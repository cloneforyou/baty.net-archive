A week ago I decided to go all-in with [Asana][1] for task management. The idea was that I no longer wanted to manage my individual tasks separately from those I delegate to others. It&#x2019;s also handy to have visibility into project requirements aside from only those things for which I&#x2019;m directly responsible.

I have a long history of switching task managers, and this may be just another one of those things, but so far Asana has been great. The app improves at a pretty good rate, and it&#x2019;s free for teams up to 15 people. 

Favorite things:

  * Forward emails to create tasks
  * Keyboard shortcuts for everything
  * It&#x2019;s fast, for a web app
  * Shared views of tasks and calendars

Less favorite things:

  * It&#x2019;s not a desktop app (but using Fluid helps)
  * Using the Tab key as a modifier for shortcuts is hard to get used to
  * No good way to organize large numbers of projects

The downside of a collaborative tool like Asana is that it benefits most from collaboration. Obviously. I&#x2019;m working on getting buy in from my partners and maybe some day the entire team could make use of it.
