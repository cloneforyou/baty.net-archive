Three days ago I began searching for a better RSS aggregator.
  

  
Sharpreader was getting goofy on me, RSS Bandit was goofy and wouldn't
  

  
let me use the system browser for links and the others were either
  

  
web-based, which is too slow, or for the [wrong platform][1]. I was
  

  
about to give up when I was reminded of Nick Bradbury's upcoming [FeedDemon][2]. You remember
  

  
Nick, he's the guy who originally wrote what is now Homesite and also
  

  
the great TopStyle CSS editor. The first FeedDemon beta was just
  

  
released, and it just may be what I was looking for. Here's what I
  

  
like&#8230;
  


  1. Very well-done interface (for Windows anyway)
  2. Support for password-protected feeds
  3. Organization of feeds into "Listings"
  4. "News Bins" as a way of sort of bookmarking feed posts from
  
    
  
    multiple sites
  5. Support for using the system default browser instead of only
  
    
  
    IE

What I don't like&#8230;
  


  1. It took me too long to grok the terms "Listing" and "Channel." This
  
    
  
    might be fine for folks new to RSS feeds, but I would have preferred
  
    
  
    something like "Feed" and "Feed Group" instead.
  2. I'd prefer the old collapsible-folder-hierarchy metaphor for listing
  
    
  
    and organizing feeds.
  3. The listing Newspaper seems unnecessary to me, but hey, it doesn't
  
    
  
    really get in the way &#8211; much

It is the only current aggregator for Windows that looks and feels
  

  
finished. There are still a few bugs, but it's in beta, so I'm sure
  

  
they will be taken care of before 1.0. Nice work Nick!
