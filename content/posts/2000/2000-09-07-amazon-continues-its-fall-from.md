Amazon continues its fall from grace &#8211; or at least continues to piss **me** off. Same thing.
  


A month ago they "lost" my account. After several emails, they said that I was back in business. Trouble was, they didn't seem to have a record of anything I had ordered since _February!_. I asked them about this and they said that they would "merge" my accounts and all would be well. Sure enough, the next day I got an email stating that my accounts had been merged. Cool, except when I logged in, nothing had changed. I waited a two weeks and asked again. The response I received said that I only had one account, and have a nice day. So much for the 7 or 8 dvd preorders that I had expected to receive 40% discounts on. Damn!
  


I finally got around to creating an account at Barnes and Noble. We'll see.
