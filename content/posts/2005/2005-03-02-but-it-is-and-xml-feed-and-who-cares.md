Chris Pirillo seems a [tad annoyed][1] that people refer to RSS feeds as "XML" feeds. This is a distinction that almost nobody will make&#8212;ever. Why? First, an RSS is feed is comprised of XML isn't it? This, in my book-of-the-real-world, makes it an XML feed also. Second, no&#8230;one&#8230;cares. Half the people you meet still call IE "The Internet" ferchrissakes.
