Starting a new book. Watching a movie I haven&#8217;t seen. Listening to a new album. Trying a new restaurant. All of these things start with the question: Am I going to like it?

My new default answer is, &#8220;Yes, I am. I&#8217;m going to love it.&#8221; I give it 5 stars and I haven&#8217;t even _tried_ it yet!

And it&#8217;s fine if it turns out otherwise. I&#8217;m allowed to not like things, too.

But why start out not liking things?

Why do so many people seem to be just _itching_ to find fault? I don&#8217;t get it. Why not go in expecting to be amazed? For example, I watch all sorts of movies that I know are likely to be, say, mediocre. But, before I watch them, I don&#8217;t _know_, right? So why not sit back and prepare to love it? What if it&#8217;s great? Or even if it&#8217;s not great, what if there are just a few really good parts?

If a movie sucks I&#8217;m going to be disappointed, sure, but I prefer to be the kind of person who feels a little disappointed after watching a bad movie rather than the kind who yells and points, &#8220;See! I told it was terrible!&#8221; I don&#8217;t want to act like that.

Give things the benefit of the doubt, I say.
