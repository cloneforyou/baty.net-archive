title: Preparing for a new iMac

A beautiful new 27&#8243; Retina iMac is arriving tomorrow for use in my home office. This affords an opportunity to start fresh.

I'm not starting completely over and will restore from a Time Machine backup, so I've spent much of today cleaning files and removing unused applications. A _lot_ of unused applications.

It's amazing how much crap I've collected in the 5 years since first booting the iMac it's replacing.
