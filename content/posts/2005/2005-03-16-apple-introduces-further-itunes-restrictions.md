Most sane people hate DRM right along with the products that implement it. I tend to grant a little leeway for those companies who at least _seem_ to be trying to strike a fair balance. Apple and the iTunes Music Store are (or were) a good example of this. You see, the problem with Digital Rights Management is that the "Rights" part can be terribly mis-"Managed". The latest iTunes update, for example, (once again) **reduces** the rights I have to share and stream the music I paid for. There's nothing stopping them from continuing this behaviour. Cory Doctorow [has more][1].
