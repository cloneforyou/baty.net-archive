For as long as I can remember, 90% of my meals have included ketchup packets and a less than heartfelt "have a nice day" from the young person smiling blandly through a drive-through window. Not good. Recently I've been trying to turn this around by actually cooking my meals. So far, it's been fun and somewhat successful. I have cookbooks and there are plenty of helpful websites. Pictures help! One thing that many cookbooks lack is practical instruction on the actual food preparation. They tend to assume I'm not an idiot with a knife or other utensil. This assumption could get someone killed. Today, [Kottke][1] pointed me to a great, [illustrated article][2] on handling a knife and using to cut things (that don't bleed afterwards.) Very helpful.
