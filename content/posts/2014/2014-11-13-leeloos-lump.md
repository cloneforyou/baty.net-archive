title: Leeloo' Lump
url: /2014/leeloos-lump/
---

During [Leeloo’s knee surgery][1] last week, I asked the doctor to remove a lump from her side, just in case. I had a biopsy done and it turns out it was a cancerous tumor; some sort of -noma. The doctor said he had removed an extra large area and that the results showed the procedure was curative. 

A little good news is nice.
