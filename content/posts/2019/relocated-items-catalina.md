title: Relocated Items, Catalina

From a "Relocated Items" folder (alias, actually) on my MBP desktop after upgrading...

> Some of your files had been in a location that is now incompatible with macOS security settings. These files were moved to the Security folder for your review.
> If there are any files you want to keep, you can move them to a new location, as long as it is different from their location before the upgrade or migration.

Screw you, Catalina. I don't feel like messing with this nonsense.
