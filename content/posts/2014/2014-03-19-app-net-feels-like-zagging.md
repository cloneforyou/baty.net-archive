I have a tendency to &#x201c;zag&#x201d; when everyone else is zigging. It&#x2019;s a combination of a need to explore and my built-in contrarianism. 

For example, everyone uses Twitter. Using Twitter is zigging. It&#x2019;s the easy choice. App.net (specifically [alpha.app.net][1]) is the zag. It&#x2019;s newer and, to the uninitiated, nothing more than a Twitter clone that no one uses. That&#x2019;s really too bad. On the other hand it&#x2019;s clean, useful, and quiet. Too quiet for some, maybe. 

My annual App.net subscription is set to renew soon I thought I&#x2019;d dive back in and see how it feels these days. Turns out it feels pretty good. It&#x2019;s a smaller &#x201c;audience&#x201d; but it&#x2019;s an interesting group.

Also, I didn&#x2019;t know they introduced a simple App.net-based commenting system, so I added it here on my static, [Tinderbox][2]-based blog. It&#x2019;s a one-liner so why not? Here&#x2019;s the original blog post: [What is the app.net comments widget][3]? I like it. 

I find that the App.net comments widget is much cleaner and simpler than the mess that is Disqus.
