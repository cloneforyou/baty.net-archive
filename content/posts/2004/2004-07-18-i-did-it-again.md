Once in a while it would be nice to have a digital camera handy. I still have my old casio exilim, but I hate using it. Since I sold the Digital Rebel to [Steve][1] and bought all sorts of film gear, I was left without anything digital. What I wanted was something small enough to take everywhere, but not so small that it's hard to handle. I wanted a simple point and shoot but with manual options, just in case. After much research, I settled on the Canon A80.

After about 6 hours with the camera, here's what I like&#8230;

</p> 

  * Solid construction. They actually used metal to make this thing, and it's heavy enough to feel like it won't fall apart if I squeeze it too hard.


  * Reasonable shutter lag. I can live with the lag, especially if prefocussing.


  * Controls are nicely arranged. I don't expect to accidently push the wrong button too often.


  * The lens is pretty fast &#8211; f2.8 at the wide end.


  * The rotatable LCD has already come in handy
</ul> 

What I don't like so far&#8230;

</p> 

  * The LCD is way too small. This won't always be a problem, since I usually use the optical viewfinder anyway.


  * Highest ISO is 400, although I've heard that it's actually more like 800.


  * Lotsa noise at higher ISO settings. The Rebel blows this outta the water


  * After a few test shots, it's showing a tendency to blow out highlights easily, and there is evidence of "purple fringing" &#8211; see below.
</ul>
