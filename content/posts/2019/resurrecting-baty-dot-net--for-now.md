title: Resurrecting baty.net (for now)
---

There are two things that cause me to occasionally abandon this blog at baty.net for something else.

The first is friction. Hosting with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) is wonderful, but _posting_ can feel like more trouble than it's worth. That's when things like [Blot](https://blot.im) or [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) start to look tempting.

The second is boredom. I love trying new things, so whenever I find some new blogging tool, I trick myself into thinking "This is the one, for real this time!"

So, I stop posting here and add a message letting my handful of readers know where I've gone. Of course then I find myself looking something up here that I know I posted some time in the past 15 years and poking around and wondering why I ever left.

Since re-discovering [ox-hugo - Org to Hugo exporter](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co), I've found ways to reduce the friction of publishing posts. And I love writing in Emacs and Org-mode.

All this to say that I've dusted off baty.net, re-jiggered my Hugo setup, and will be posting here again for a while.
