Today, I was going to launch Apple's Graphing Calculator for the first time since getting my iMac. Much to my surprise, it wasn't there. I went looking and found that it doesn't ship with OS X. What I found, other than a new [OS X version][1], was the [story of how it came about][2]. Assuming it's true, it's a great story.
