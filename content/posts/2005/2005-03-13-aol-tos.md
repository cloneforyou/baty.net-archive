Seems that the new AOL Terms Of Service has introduced a trivial modification that essentially gives AOL the rights to do anything it likes with your instant message conversations over AIM. (I have not read the new TOS in detail so if this turns out to be nothing but alarmist nonsense, I apologize)

See [this post][1] for more details.

Wouldn't it be nice if this finally brought the capable, extensible and open source [Jabber][2] into widespread use? It won't, but it would still be nice.
