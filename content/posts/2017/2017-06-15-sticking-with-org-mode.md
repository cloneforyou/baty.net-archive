title: Sticking with Org Mode
---

I tried moving away from [Org Mode](https://orgmode.org) four days ago. Doing so required finding
replacements for the following:

- Email client
- Task manager
- Code/text editor
- Note-taking app
- Outliner
- Publishing tool (PDF)
- Git client
- Daybook/Journal

I have [favorite apps](https://baty.net/stuff-i-use/) for all of the above, and I love using them, but it
means that I end up with my "stuff" spread all over the place. I get hung up
deciding where to write things down. Should it be a note in the Things task?
or in Bear or just a note in DEVONthink? 

In Org Mode I don't have that problem. Everything is just text and notes, and
TODOs can be mixed together any way that suits the task at hand.

Also, Vim keybindings will always be my favorite way to edit text.
With [Spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) and "evil" mode, _every_ bit of text I write can be written
using Vim keybindings; Email, notes, git commit messages, everything.

So, after just a few days away, I decided to stick with Org Mode. 

Org Mode is weird in that while putting everything in it feels "open" and
future-proof, it also sort of locks me in to using Emacs for everything. I'm OK
with that[^fornow], because the everything-in-one-place-ness of it is worth it.

[^fornow]: For now. I've been through all this before. Recording my thought process when I go through things like this helps.
