Zeldman: [Coding for easier redesigns][1] revisits some of the territory from Designing with Web Standards related to thinking structurally and how that helps later.

Note, I would have pasted a relevant quote or two, but the article itself is presented entirely in Flash, so I couldn't select or copy any of the text. What's that supposed to be, some sort of "Rich Application" DRM? Another fine example of what **not** to use Flash for. With all of the useful things that Flash is good at, why this? Sigh.
