My decision to invest time and money into [JIRA][1] and [Confluence][2] from [Atlassian][3] continues to prove fruitful, and the more integration I can find between them the better. 

One problem with the existing integration options is that authentication for showing JIRA issues within Confluence pages had to be explicit. This means login information must be stored directly as part of a page. Not great. It looks like an [elegant solution is forthcoming][4]. Can't wait.&nbsp;
