It seems to me that the more we can do to reduce distractions and clutter, the more productive we will be. I've been using [Isolator](http://willmore.eu/software/isolator/) to help with this.

It nicely and easily hides all background windows and helps focus on the task at hand. Free (but of course you'll want to donate a little something.)
