title: Oh yeah, there's still a Tilde.club!

Back in October, 2014 Paul Ford did something amazing and wrote about it: [I had a couple drinks and woke up with 1,000 nerds][1]

It was the story of [tilde.club][2].

I love the idea of tilde.club-type sites everywhere. I even [ran one][3] for a spell. Mr. Ford was kind enough to provide me with an account on the original server. You can find it at [tilde.club/~jbaty][4]. I still update it occasionally. It's comforting having a statically-served<sup id="fnref-4608-fargo"><a href="#fn-4608-fargo" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> "~" account on someone else's server.

I even pop into the local-only IRC channel. There are a few folks still around, but they're pretty quiet. Still, it's nice to know they're there.
