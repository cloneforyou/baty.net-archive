[This post][1] by Dave Winer in 1995 has always struck a chord with me. Probably because _**I**_ make shitty software and it's nice to hear that not only am I not alone, but I'm in the 100% majority.

The only software that's perfect is one you're dreaming about. Real software crashes, loses data, is hard to learn and hard to use. But it's a process. We'll make it less shitty. Just watch!"
