I'm logged in to [Twitter][1] all day, every day ([twitter.com/jackbaty][2]). It's become an important part of my workflow, or whatever you call what I do these days. 

That being the case, a good desktop Twitter client is important to me. I've been using [Twitterrific][3] since shortly after I learned how to spell it. Twitterrific is a very nice OS X app that looks good and works flawlessly for the most part, which is more than I can say for Twitter itself lately. My desire for playing with new software brought me to [Snitter][4]. Snitter was the first real Adobe Air app I ran for any length of time, but it crashed and behaved badly on my machine. Uninstalled it. (This could very well be fixed by now, but I haven't tried it recently.)

Today some folks were twittering about another Adobe Air based client, [Twhirl][5]. You know me, I had to try it at once! Grabbed the [latest Air Beta][6] and fired it up. Nice stuff: multiple Twitter account handling, themes, search, etc. I thought I was on to something. Then I tried using it and that's where things started to go wrong. First thing I noticed is that the window would jump out from underneath the cursor whenever I clicked anywhere on the app. Not good, but what finally killed the experience for me was the text rendering. I'm a pretty forgiving guy when it comes to fonts and such, but the text was rendered terribly.

I experimented with a few different fonts but they all looked wonky. Does anyone know if this is an Air thing or is it something specific to my install? I can't even read that. Text handling doesn't feel right either. For example, selected text is black rather than my system's highlight color. Dealing with Twitter's 140-character-at-a-time limit makes these issues less of a real problem, but still. Oh and Air really needs Growl support.

I mentioned earlier on Twitter that Air apps "don't feel right." The above is a brief explanation why.

As I left the Adobe conference a few months ago, I said that "Air is a game changer," and I still believe that. Over the past months, we've been building a number of Flex apps at [Fusionary][7] and so far the results have been outstanding. Flex apps may have some challenges to overcome, but improving the user experience in a browser is a lot easier than improving upon that of native _desktop_ apps. I'm looking forward to leveraging web work on the desktop. Someday.

As for Twhirl and Snitter, they're great early attempts using Adobe Air. I like that they'll keep the pressure on Iconfactory to improve Twitterrific. The problem is that I'm not going to use them day to day just _because_ they're Air apps. They have to be _better_ apps, and they're not &#8211; yet.
