I must confess to a recent infatuation with the idea of "Audiophile-grade" gear. I don't necessarily want to _own_ the stuff (that would be just crazy, right?) but I would like to understand the unbelievable lengths people will go (and money they'll spend) on listening to music.

And now, From PsiberAudio, [tube amps for your iPod][1]. With features like "Massive 1.2 Farads of reservoir capacitance in the power supply," how can I **not** want one?
