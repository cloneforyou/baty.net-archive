After listening to David Foster Wallace interviewed on [Talk of the Nation][1], I remembered to buy his new book, [Everything and More: A Compact History of Infinity][2]. The "Thanks for your order" page at Amazon recommended that I buy a book by an author who's work Wallace's is frequently compared to, Don Delillo. And as we all know, Don Delillo wrote a book titled [White Noise][3]. Strange and suprisingly irrelevant.
