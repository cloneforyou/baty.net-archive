**Project VimR — Refined Vim experience for OS&nbsp;**

I love the idea of [VimR][1]. Take "real" Vim and add OS X friendly features. More friendly than MacVim, I mean. Things such as a built-in file browser that acts like NERDTree but part of the UI.

My ideal editor would be BBEdit with complete Vim bindings. Until then, I'll keep waffling between BBEdit and Vim and hope that VimR gets closer. Currently I can't even open a document in VimR (probably a Yosemite thing) but I'm looking forward to it.
