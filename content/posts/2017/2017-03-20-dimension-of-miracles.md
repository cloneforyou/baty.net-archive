[Dimension Of Miracles](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/668634.Dimension_of_Miracles) by Robert Scheckley was a fun Science Fiction romp from 1968. It felt very much like "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy" but predates it by many years. 

I thought it was funny, smart, and clever. The audio book is read by John Hodgman, who did a fine job.
