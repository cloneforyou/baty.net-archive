title: IBM Watson Analyzes My Twitter
---

IBM Watson analyzed my Twitter account and came up with this:

> You are skeptical, inner-directed and unconventional.
> 
> You are reserved: you are a private person and don't let many people in. You
> are independent: you have a strong desire to have time to yourself. And you
> are self-conscious: you are sensitive about what others might be thinking
> about you.
> 
> You are motivated to seek out experiences that provide a strong feeling of
> discovery.
> 
> You are relatively unconcerned with both tradition and taking pleasure in
> life. You care more about making your own path than following what others have
> done. And you prefer activities with a purpose greater than just personal
> enjoyment.
