Spent the first part of the evening watching _School of Rock_ with Jess and it was even better the second time.

I immediately had a fit of rock-n-roll nostalgia and ran out straight away to the nearest shop to replace a few of the vinyl records I'd worn out back in the early eighties. AC/DC's Back in Black and Highway to Hell along with an old collection of tunes by The Clash. I could've bought every classic rock CD in the place so I got out as quickly as I could.

Got back home, turned the stereo up to an uncharacteristic volume and spent the next hour or so jumping spastically around the house playing a screamingly-wicked air guitar while Jessica drummed on everything in sight with a pair of chopsticks.

Made a mess, soaked myself with sweat, irritated the neighbors and likely left my daughter with numerous psychological scars caused by seeing me dance around like an aging punk rocker playing his last gig at some out of the way casino.

It was quite honestly the most fun I've had in a very long time.
