Would you all please just start a blog? I don&#8217;t care which platform you choose. Pick one and publish. Cross-post or don&#8217;t. Implement Webmentions or don&#8217;t. Allow comments or don&#8217;t. Tweak the design to within an inch of its life or don&#8217;t. Publish long posts or short, it doesn&#8217;t matter.

Just please write stuff and publish it and provide an RSS/Atom/JSON feed so I can easily keep up with it. It&#8217;s pretty easy.

I shouldn&#8217;t need Twitter or Facebook for this stuff.
