If I were making lots of huge landscape prints, having a 4&#215;5 camera would be an advantage. I'm not making huge prints of any kind, so having a 4&#215;5 camera is entirely unnecessary. With that in mind, I just bought a Burke & James 4&#215;5 Speed Press. As you do.</p>

I have film and a JOBO. All I need is a few 4&#215;5 film holders and I could actually use the thing. Can't wait.
