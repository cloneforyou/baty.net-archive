One of the things on my list this weekend was to write some fancy deployment/configuration [Switchtower][1] recipes to aid in setting up new sites (which I've been doing a \*lot\* of lately.) After seeing the [RailsMachine][2] video it appears that they've given me yet another reason to believe that [procrastination is good for you][3]. Apparently, their recipes are to be made available, and they look very similar to what I had planned on trying myself. Goodie for me!
