Apparently, Bryan H. was having a bit of fun with the conference name tag of none other than DHH when he heard someone clearing his throat. Turning around, there was David, holding an empty lanyard, waiting patiently for his identity to be returned to him. I wasn't there, but the look on Bryan's face must've been priceless.
