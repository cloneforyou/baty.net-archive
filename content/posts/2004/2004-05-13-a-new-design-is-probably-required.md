I'm having fun using [WordPress][1] to publish this weblog, but the design (which I stole and tweaked) just blows. There's something too heavy about it. Looking at it makes me uncomfortable, and that _can't_ be good.

May just roll back to a simple even-more-boring-but-readable look until something better comes along. I may even have to ask for [professional help][2] this time.
