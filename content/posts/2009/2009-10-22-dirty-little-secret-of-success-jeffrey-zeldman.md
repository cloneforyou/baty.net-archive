    <p>
      A contented person with a whole heart, who has never doubted for a moment that she is loved by God and the universe, should not bother trying to succeed as a creative entrepreneur. She should get a job working for someone else, turn it off at 6:00 PM, and come home to the people who love her.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Only a restless, broken heart can drive you to do what is necessary.
