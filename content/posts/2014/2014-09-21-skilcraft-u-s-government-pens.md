There are so many glowing reviews of the Skilcraft pens that I had to try them. They've been around forever and have a [great story][1]. A box of 12 costs $15, so the risk was pretty low.

My experience is that they're pretty lousy pens. For a buck apiece I shouldn't expect much, but they feel terrible in hand and the few that I've actually tried using have skipped regularly. They're not supposed to do that. I'll never know if they write in the rain or not because I'm not willing to go that far. Outside of nostalgia I can't think of any reason to recommend them.
