That's right, _bought_. I prefer owning things to renting, but I've been lazy and it's been a while since I've bought anything digital. Here's what I picked up today.

**La Chinga &#8211; "Freewheelin'"**

I'd have grabbed this one based on the album cover alone. Good time hard rock.

**Baroness &#8211; "Purple"**

I enjoyed "Yellow and Green" and this one seems like more of the same.

**The Dead Weather &#8211; "Dodge and Burn"**

With a title like "Dodge and Burn" of course I'm in. I like Jack White and really like this band. I've nearly worn out "Horehound". A vinyl copy of this one is on the way also.

I burned all three to CD so I can listen to them in the car, since I hate wiring up my iPhone and finding/playing music on it while trying to drive.
