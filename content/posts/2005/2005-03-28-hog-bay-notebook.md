Being a huge fan of outliners, I've pretty much tried them all. OmniOutliner is about the best of them, but is a little too twitchy for my taste. If you like outliners but wish they would manage larger amounts of text or include a better search engine or basically just _feel_ better, look no further than [Hog Bay Notebook][1]

Here's a screenshot of a (seriously pruned) version of the notebook I use for managing my GTD tasks&#8230;

It's light, fast, and feels exactly like an app such as this should. Better text handling than OmniOutliner and better outlining than DevonTHINK. I'm diggin' it.
