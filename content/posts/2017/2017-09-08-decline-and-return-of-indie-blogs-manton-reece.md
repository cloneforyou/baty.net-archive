[Manton Reece][1]:

> The solution isn’t fewer link blogs, but more of them. By taking microblogging back from Twitter, we create a natural place for traditional blogs to grow. Indie microblogging is the gateway drug for long-form content.

I&#8217;d love for this to be true, but I wonder if it is. If short-form blogging was the gateway drug to long-form blogging, wouldn&#8217;t Twitter have already lead the way? I&#8217;m rooting for the Indieweb, but not sure we&#8217;ll ever be able to pull ourselves out of the situation we&#8217;ve created.

(The irony of this being a link post isn&#8217;t lost on me)
