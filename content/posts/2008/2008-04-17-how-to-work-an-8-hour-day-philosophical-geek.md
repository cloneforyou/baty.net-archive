I'm busy. I have too much to do. I work as much or more than anyone I know much of the time. And it's all my fault.

Having too much to do in too short a time is nothing more than bad planning. I'm convinced that working 12-hour days trying to catch up is not the answer. Not even in the short term. I don't know what the answer is, but I'll be sure to let you know as soon as I figure it out. In the meantime, read this terrific, balanced piece about the fallacy of 12-hour work days: [How to work an 8-hour day | Philosophical Geek][1]
