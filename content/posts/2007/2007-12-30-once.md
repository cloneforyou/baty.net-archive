There's nothing better than knowing, in the first few minutes of a film, that you're about to see something wonderful. It just happened to me with [Once][1] &#8211; a documentary style, sparse, completely fantastic musical. Seriously one of the very best movies you'll see this year. Or wait a couple of days and it will be one of the best movies you'll see _next_ year. I fell in love with it. Bet you will too.
