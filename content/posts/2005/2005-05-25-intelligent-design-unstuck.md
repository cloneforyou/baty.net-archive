Someone has come to their senses and forced the goofballs in Cobb County GA to remove those unintentionally hilarious evolution disclaimer stickers from the science textbooks. I mean after all, they are "science" textbooks right? Since when did we start referring to metaphysical nonsense like "Intelligent Design" as science?

By the way, my favorite related ID quote is by non other than Douglass Adams&#8230;

Anyway, the stickers are coming off &#8211; and thank God for that, eh? [link][1]
