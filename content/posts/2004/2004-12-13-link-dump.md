I've tossed together a simple page containing links that I run across and find nifty or somehow interesting. For now, it's called [Link Dump][1]. If I keep it fresh it'll stay. Otherwise I'll pull the plug. And no, I don't like the layout of it either. If everything had to be perfect right outta the box, nothing at all would ship.
