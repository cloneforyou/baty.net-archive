I always begin by following the advice I first read on the XP portion of Ward Cunningham&#8217;s wiki, and that is, &#8220;[Do the simplest thing that could possibly work][1]&#8221;

Good intentions give way to analysis which gives way to changing my mind about what every word in that quote actually means.

So here I am with another blog. It&#8217;s WordPress, and it&#8217;s using a very basic theme, and there&#8217;s only been a tiny bit of customization done.

I have been labeling things as &#8220;experiments&#8221; so that I don&#8217;t feel badly about changing my mind later. So let&#8217;s call this new blog an experiment to see how I&#8217;m feeling these days about WordPress vs Static, etc. etc.

Some days I want to play on the command line and make fun scripts and other days I just want to type stuff and hit &#8220;Publish&#8221;. Today is one of those latter days.
