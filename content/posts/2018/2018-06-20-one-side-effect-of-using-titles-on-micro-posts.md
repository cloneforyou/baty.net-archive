title: One side effect of using titles on “micro” posts
url: /2018/one-side-effect-of-using-titles-on-micro-posts/
---
Blog posts with a title are not displayed in full on the [micro.blog][1] feed. Micro.blog will only show the title and a link to the post.

I love the interaction that takes place on Micro.blog and worry that if only links to my short posts show there, people won&#8217;t bother to click through and the conversations won&#8217;t happen. And, if they _do_ click through, it won&#8217;t be worth it just for a 240-character snippet I just fired off without much thought. I don&#8217;t want to waste people&#8217;s time that way.

On the other hand, looking at [my blog from more than a decade ago][2] reminded me that I _like_ titles. Even on short posts. This means that I can either blog the way I want to blog and potentially miss out on some fun discussions. Or, I can twist things so that they are rendered more optimally on micro.blog.

I&#8217;ve decided I should just blog how I want to blog. Micro.blog is awesome (I love you all), but it&#8217;s better as an adjunct to my blog and not the other way around.

Hope that&#8217;s ok.
