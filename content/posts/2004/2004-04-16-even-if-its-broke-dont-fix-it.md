Eric Meyer thinks that [Weblogs are broken][1], in that they show the most recent entries first, and of course that's not how we read books, so we should switch things around to read "normally"

Two thoughts on that,

A. We don't read weblogs the same way as anything else, so different is not by definition wrong.

B. Even if it is wrong, changing it now is a bad idea. I was all confused reading his blog, then I realized that he actually _had_ switched the order of his entries around. Like watching _Memento_ backwards.
