I learned today that Meijer, the last nearby option for C-41 processing, is no longer doing C-41 processing.

This means I&#8217;m left to my own devices. Thankfully, that device is a JOBO CPE-2 with lift. Processing color film isn&#8217;t difficult, so I dug the JOBO out of the basement and mixed up a fresh batch of chemicals. I&#8217;ll be processing my own color film from now on.
