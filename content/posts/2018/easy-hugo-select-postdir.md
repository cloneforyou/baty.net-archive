[Easy Hugo](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo) is a handy Emacs mode for posting to Hugo-based blogs. One difficulty I had was that I have many content directories, and easy hugo only included methods for moving through directories one at a time.

In a related bug report, I suggested that being able to quickly select the content directory would be useful, and the author, [masasam](https://github.com/masasam), just [added the feature](https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo/issues/42#issuecomment-431795287). Works great.
