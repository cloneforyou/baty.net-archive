[Jon
  

  
Udell][1]: "It seems kind of unfair, doesn't it? First, developers
  

  
have to understand and accommodate users' habits. Then we have to
  

  
deliver solutions that add value while surreptitiously encouraging
  

  
users to adopt better habits. Finally, we have to bring to the
  

  
surface, examine, and modify our own deeply-ingrained habits. That's a
  

  
painful and psychologically hard thing to do. But happy users are not
  

  
the only reward. The habit of breaking habits will serve you well."
