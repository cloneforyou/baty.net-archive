When [Smile Software][1] announced their new subscription pricing model I was initially incredulous. I don’t like paying subscriptions and theirs was a significant increase in pricing while offering nothing compelling for me as a user. I bailed and moved my most important snippets into [Keyboard Maestro][2]. KM is not as slick for doing expansions as TE but it works and I already own it. (“Own” being the operative word).

Today Smile [announced that they were updating pricing][3]. For existing users, the price is $20/year. This is a lifetime discount. $20 per year is a much more realistic price to pay for a utility like TextExpander, so I was happy to see it. Besides, living without it for a few days reminded me how valuable a utility it is. I’ve signed up.
