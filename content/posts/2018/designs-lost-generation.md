title: Design's Lost Generation - Mike Monteiro
---
[Mike Monteiro](https://medium.com/@monteiro/designs-lost-generation-ac7289549017):

> ...those of us currently drawing paychecks for professional design services — are design’s lost generation. We are the Family Ties era Michael J. Fox of the design lineage. Raised by hippies. Consumed by greed. Ruled by the hand of the market. And nourished by the last drops of sour milk from the withered old teat of capitalism gone rabid. Living where America ends — Silicon Valley.

Mike sometimes rubs me the wrong way, but that may be because he's usually on to something that I've missed.
