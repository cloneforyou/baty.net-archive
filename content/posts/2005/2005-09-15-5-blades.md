Gillette introduces [Fusion][1] the 5-bladed razor. I _guarantee_ you that 5 blades won't give you a better shave than say, three. And yet here we are.

[Update] [Dan][2] points out [this article][3] over at The Onion. I love those guys, thanks Dan. Here's a taste&#8230;

We didn't claw our way to the top of the razor game by clinging to the two-blade industry standard. We got here by taking chances. Well, five blades is the biggest chance of all."

Here she comes: Put another aloe strip on that fucker, too. That's right. Five blades, two strips, and make the second one lather. You heard me&#8212;the second strip lathers. It's a whole new way to think about shaving. Don't question it. Don't say a word. Just key the music, and call the chorus girls, because we're on the edge&#8212;the razor's edge&#8212;and I feel like dancing."
