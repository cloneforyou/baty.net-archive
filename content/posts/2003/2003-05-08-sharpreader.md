I've been using the Synderella RSS aggregator for reading my news.
  

  
Mostly nice, but I really wanted to be able to organize my growing
  

  
list of feeds into categories, folders, whatever. Along comes [SharpReader][1],
  

  
another .NET RSS reader, but with most of the features I like,
  

  
including categories. Now if I could only get it to open links in
  

  
Mozilla rather than IE, I'd be happy. Oh, and the threaded
  

  
posts/trackback UI is **very** cool.
