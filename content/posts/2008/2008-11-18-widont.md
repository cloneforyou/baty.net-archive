<span class="drop_cap">T</span>ypography is not my strong suit. It's almost _nobody's_ strong suit, which is fine by me. I don't know a really good font when I see one, and I don't care that much. I'm sure it's all critically important, but to most of us it's just navel-gazing.

When someone points out a really glaring typographical error I might take notice, and agree. "Widows" for example, are apparently an affront to typographical good taste everywhere. I wouldn't typically go too far out of my way to avoid them. If it was easy, maybe. As it turns out, it _is_ easy. Shaun Inman has written the [Widon't plugin for WordPress][1]. Just dropped it in, and now at least my post titles will be sans-widows. Happy now?
