I like Seth Godin because he always makes me consider or reconsider something previously assumed. His latest piece lists a number of _reasons_ for the way things are. Some obvious, some not. Some are funny, like this one&#8230; 

> The reason you have a front lawn is to demonstrate to your friends and neighbors how much time and energy you're prepared to waste. 

I must not waste *any* time!
