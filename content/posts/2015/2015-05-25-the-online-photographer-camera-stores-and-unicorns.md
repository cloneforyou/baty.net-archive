[Mike Johnston][1]:

> The other day I was driving north on US23 towards Ann Arbor and home. On the right a large billboard flashed by advertising <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CameraMall " target="_blank">CameraMall</a>, a new camera store in downtown Ann Arbor, Michigan. I blinked my eyes, turned down the music, and thought that perhaps I had just hallucinated. A new camera store in Ann Arbor? No way! Yesterday I parked my car and walked up Washington Street, behind the legendary Michigan Theater, and, sure enough, there it wasâ€”a camera store. I could not have been more surprised if I had seen a knight of the realm riding a unicorn up the street.

Interesting that they carry a decent selection of film.
