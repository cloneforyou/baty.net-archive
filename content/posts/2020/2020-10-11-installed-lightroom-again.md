When I recently [deleted all my Adobe apps](https://www.baty.net/2020/deleting-adobe/) I forgot to consider how much I rely [Negative Lab Pro](https://www.negativelabpro.com) for processing film scans.

I'm slowly developing a film scanning workflow using a digital camera rather than a flatbed scanner, and a key component of the process is NLP. NLP is especially useful for color film. Even though I don't shoot much color, NLP has proven to be by far my favorite tool for getting reasonable color from C-41 film. It only works with Lightroom Classic.

So I installed Lightroom on my iMac. Again.
