Looks like Toshiba is [throwing in the HD-<span class="caps"><span class="caps">DVD</span></span> towel][1]

I really didn't care who won, as long as the war ended. Seems that is about to happen. Guess I'm suddenly in the market for a Playstation 3 <del>game system</del> Blu-Ray player.

Of course I'll probably just be getting all of my HD content from iTunes via AppleTV by then anyway.
