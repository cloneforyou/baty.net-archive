As a big fan of Roger Ebert (and yes, he's smarter than you and I put together) I was delighted to find a list of [his most hated movies][1]

_Joe Dirt_, check. _The Waterboy_, check. _Armageddon_, I'm witchya. _Tommy Boy_&#8230; wait a *#&$%ing minute! _Tommy Boy_?!!&nbsp; I can be a little bit of a film snob, but damn Rog, how dare you claim that "There are no memorable lines!" I use a line from the movie practically every day and my daughter and I can have entire conversations built upon bits from the movie.

Richard: Can't hear you, you're trailing off and did I catch a niner in there? Were you calling from a walkie-talkie?

Richard: I can practically hear you getting fatter.

Tommy: You know a lot of people go to college for seven years."

Richard: "I know, they're called doctors.

Richard: I don't remember eating that.

Richard: I think your brain has a thick candy shell. 

Tommy: Your&#8230; Your brain has the shell on it. 

Richar: Are you talking? 

Tommy: Shut up, Richard.

Well, you get the idea &#8211; comic genius.
