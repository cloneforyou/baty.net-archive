Shirky has a great article, [Ontology is Overrated&#8212;Categories, Links, and Tags][1] which describes some of the advantages of tagging systems versus a typical hierarchical ontology. I love the Dewey Decimal System example categorization for religions of the world&#8230;

<pre>Dewey, 200: Religion
210 Natural theology
220 Bible
230 Christian theology
240 Christian moral &#38; devotional theology
250 Christian orders &#38; local church
260 Christian social theology
270 Christian church history
280 Christian sects &#38; denominations
290 Other religions</pre>

No bias there, eh?

And a couple on the del.icio.us/flickr idea of tagging&#8230;

That's funny. And this&#8230;

By forgoing formal classification, tags enable a huge amount of user-produced organizational value, at vanishingly small cost."
