I started using [Firefox][1] when it was called "Phoenix" and was still at something like version 0.0.0.5. (and already better than IE.) You all know they just released version 1.0, so just go ahead and upgrade.

Everyone has been feeding the rumor mill about Google building a browser. I don't know anything about that, but did y'all notice that the new Firefox start page is <http://www.google.com/firefox>. Interesting. (I tried <google.com/ie> and I'm not sure I get the joke, if there is one)
