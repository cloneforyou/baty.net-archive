[Leonard Cohen - "The
Future"](http://genius.com/Leonard-cohen-the-future-lyrics):

> Things are going to slide (slide) in all directions Won’t be nothing
> (won’t be) Nothing you can measure anymore The blizzard, the blizzard
> of the world Has crossed the threshold And it has overturned The order
> of the soul
>
> When they said (they said) repent (repent), repent (repent) I wonder
> what they meant

"The blizzard of the world has crossed the threshold," indeed.
