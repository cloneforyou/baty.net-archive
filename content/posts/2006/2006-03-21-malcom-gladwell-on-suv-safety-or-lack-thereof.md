Do you drive your big, selfish, me-first S.U.V. because you think it's safer? If so, Malcom Gladwell [thinks you're wrong][1]. 

> S.U.V.s are unsafe because they make their drivers feel safe.&nbsp; That feeling of safety isn't the solution; it's the problem.&nbsp; 

There's an interesting chart in there with deaths per million cars for a number of vehicles. It's interesting to see how poorly the S.U.V.s fared.
