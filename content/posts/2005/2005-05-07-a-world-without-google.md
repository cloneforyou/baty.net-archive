My home iMac G5 is at the shop. Thus, I spent 3 nights with no computer, mostly wandering around the house muttering to myself. In order to avoid an entire weekend of that, I packed up my office iMac and brought it home. There, much better.

And then, suddenly, while trying to find something about something, I get a "Page not found" error on Google. Wierd, so I tried again with no luck. 2 minutes later I tried yet again and when going to <http://www.google.com> I end up seeing a page for the SoGoSearch search engine. WTF? It's been nearly an hour and the only thing I've learned is that a world without Google is a scary place.

**Update**: Seems it was a DNS issue. Pretty damn serious one I reckon.
