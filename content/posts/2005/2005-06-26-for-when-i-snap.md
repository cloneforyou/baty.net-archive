When I finally snap, assuming I survive the first 20 minutes, I'll probably buy this [quaint little 17th century fort][1] on its own island, "Imposingly poised in the central approach to europe's 4th largest port, with spectacular and moody setting, own jetty, and many parts." Starting at only &#163;150,000. That's like $12.00USD right?
