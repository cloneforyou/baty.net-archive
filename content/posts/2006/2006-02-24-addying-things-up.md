![Addy][1] 

So [we](<http://www.fusionary.com>) did pretty well at the ADDY awards last night. A couple of Silvers, a Gold, and Best of Show. On top of that, our own [Dan Tobolic](<http://www.freshdan.com/>) walked away with his own Gold, Silver, and Best of Show in the Student category. Exciting stuff. Nice work everyone. </p>
