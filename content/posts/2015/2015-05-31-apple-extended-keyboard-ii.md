I've now been reacquainted with what might be the best keyboard ever made, the [Apple Extended Keyboard II][1]. I've been using one at both my home and office desks for a month or so and they are as great as I remember. The one pictured above is a filthy mess because I haven't gotten around to cleaning it yet. Some day I may take it apart and give it a good scrubbing.

There are downsides to using these keyboards..

  1. No USB ports.
  2. Caps Lock key actually locks, making remapping it to the Control key impossible. This isn't great for Vim users like me.

Neither are reason enough switch back to any other keyboard.
