A [first
  

  
hand account][1] of the meeting where Steve Jobs and Jeff Bezos were
  

  
introduced to the Segway. Jobs said he lived seven minutes from a
  

  
grocery and wasn't sure he would use Ginger to get there. Bezos agreed.

Jobs: "I think it sucks&#8230;Its shape is not innovative, it's not
  

  
elegant, it doesn't feel anthropomorphic."
