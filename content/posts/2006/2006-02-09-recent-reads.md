Thought I'd share a one or two word opinion of a few recently read items&#8230; 

_[On Photography](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0312420099/qid=1139454653/sr=2-1/ref=pd_bbs_b_2_1/002-0380475-2045601?s=books&v=glance&n=283155)_ (Susan Sontag) 


![][2] 

Smart, fascinating look at photography in a social context. Nice change of pace from the usual gadget chatter. </p> 

[Marley and Me](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060817089/) (John Grogan) 


![][3] 

Funny and touching story taking place over 13 years between a man and his dog. I cried like a baby at the end. Honest. </p> 

_[Consider the Lobster](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316156116/)_ (David Foster Wallace) 


![][4] 

The always-smarter-than-you-and-everyone-you-know DFW writes a series of essays ranging from the porn industry to John McCain to Lobster festivals. My favorite is a piece about "\_A Dictionary of Modern English Usage\_" in which he discusses (at great length) "proper" english usage and who gets to decide its, uh, properness. </p>
