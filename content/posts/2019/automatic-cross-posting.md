title: Automatic Cross-posting
---

Should I automatically cross-post from baty.net to all the usual places? I don't know. Sometimes I feel like I would just be adding noise where no more noise is needed. Other times I figure what the hell, everyone else does it and people seem to love noise. Besides, it's fun to share.

What I realized was that I often wish some of the people I follow would write more posts or show more photos or otherwise add to my feed. In the unlikely event that there are people out there who feel that way about me, I've once again enabled cross-posting. Apologies in advance if you're not one of them.
