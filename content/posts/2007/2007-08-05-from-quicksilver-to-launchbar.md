[Quicksilver][1] is the best launcher available. It’s got triggers, plugins, every conceivable option you could think of, third party contributions, and it’s free.

And yet&#8230;

  Yesterday I switched from Quicksilver to <a href="http://www.obdev.at/products/launchbar/index.html">Launchbar</a>. Why’s that, you ask? In this case it’s because Quicksilver’s 43 quadzillion features haven’t stopped it from crashing pretty regularly. Like 3 or 4 times a day regularly. Turns out that LaunchBar is faster, easier to understand and has all of the features I actually use. It’s not free, but with something this indispensable, $20 isn’t a factor in the decision. Whodathunk.
