Finally, Bryan picks up his blogging stick and starts pounding away at it. Calling it [slice of life][1], he is posting tiny slivers of photos all stacked together in a sort of cross-section of specific events.

Neat concept, but I've gotta learn to stop frantically clicking on each slice, cursing and hoping to see more of what look to be interesting shots.
