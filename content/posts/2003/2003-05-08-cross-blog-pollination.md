I couldn't decide if the [New2Flash][1] weblog
  

  
should be implemented seperately from my main weblog, or as an entirely
  

  
different blog. I wanted to play with a few of the [blosxom][2] plugins, so I
  

  
finally decided to implement it separately. Then I promptly changed my
  

  
mind, sort of. Today it hit me that one of the best thing about blosxom
  

  
and phposxom is a compatible and interchangable data format, duh. What I
  

  
ended up doing is symlinking the New2Flash data directory from within
  

  
the White Noise story directories, effectively giving me **both**!
