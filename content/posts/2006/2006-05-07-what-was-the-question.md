I can't concentrate. Not sure why. Too many times recently I've spotted a browser or terminal window and said "Oh, yeah, that's what I was going to work on." There is a subtle flaw in the way my brain works that simply will not allow me to focus. GTD has helped, but as a way to recover from distractions rather than helping me to avoid them in the first place. I wrote a [short poem][1] years ago that seems to indicate this is not a new problem. I'm going to have to try something new. When I figure out what that is, I'll let you know &#8211; unless I forget.
