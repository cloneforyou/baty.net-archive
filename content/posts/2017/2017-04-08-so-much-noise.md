+++
While scrolling through Twitter today I realized that the signal-to-noise ratio
on the internet has skewed way toward noise. It's been this way for a while but
today just seemed especially bad.

Occasionally I'll become so frustrated that I quit social media. It never
sticks. I find such wonderful things online. The people I follow on Twitter or
Medium or RSS write or link to beautiful, smart, educational stuff. I love it.

What I don't love is how long it's been taking to find the interesting stuff. My
nicely-curated streams have become floods of political complaints and outrage
over _everything_. The complaints are valid and the outrage is necessary, but
they're not what I'm looking for and I have no idea how to fix any of it.
