The following is a list of gadgets, services, software and such that had a significant impact on me in 2007. Mostly it's just stuff I like, in no particular order.

  * [Amazon Kindle][1] &#8211; Goofy looking and flawed, but has revolutionized how &#8211; and how much &#8211; I read.
  * [Garmin nüvi 660][2] &#8211; <span class="caps">GPS</span> and on-the-fly driving directions made simple. Indespensible after the first time I used it.
  * [Tinderbox][3] &#8211; Rediscovered in 2007. Still the most usefull app on my Mac.
  * [Fujitsu ScanSnap S510M][4] &#8211; Last minute addition makes scanning and storing all sorts of paper documents simple. Add <span class="caps">DEVON</span>think Pro Office and go paperless.
  * [Think][5] &#8211; Simple app that helps minimize distractions, when that's what you need.
  * [Drobo][6] &#8211; Simple, expandible and redundant storage. [More][7]
  * [iPhone][8] &#8211; It's not just a phone, but you knew that
  * Uncluttering &#8211; The process of just getting rid of shit is liberating. More to come.
  * [Jira/Confluence][9] &#8211; Issue tracking and knowledge capture using these tools from Atlassian is (slowly and sometimes painfully) changing project management at Fusionary (yes, for the better, don't argue with me).
  * [AeroPress][10] &#8211; Manual, simple, small and cheap. Makes delicious coffee. [more][11]
  * <span class="caps">IMAP</span> in Gmail &#8211; Gmail, now with any mail client you like (like maybe the iPhone).
  * [Amazon MP3 Store][12] &#8211; I have very little use for the iTunes Store now. Took me completely by surprise. [More][13]
  * [Twitter][14] &#8211; Started out as a nifty gimmick. Now it's an integral part of how I learn and communicate.

Overall a pretty damn good year I think.
