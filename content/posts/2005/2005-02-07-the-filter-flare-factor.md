I never use a UV filter on any lens, even the absurdly expensive ones. **Especially** on the absurdly expensive ones. With so much attention paid to the fine art of lens design and construction, it just _can’t_ be a good thing to toss some cheapo filter in front of it. This [Luminous Landscape article][1] agrees, and goes into more detail – with examples.
