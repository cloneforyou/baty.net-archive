<img class="size-full wp-image-5185 alignright" src="/img/2016/05/spacemacs.png" alt="spacemacs" width="150" height="155" />I've been trying to quit Org Mode and Spacemacs for weeks. Everything was going fine untilÂ I accidentally double-clicked a .org file and Spacemacs opened the file. Then it was all over.

There's nothing that comes close to Org Mode for task management, document production, and general editing. I just wish it worked on my iPad without having to jump through all sorts of hoops. Again.
