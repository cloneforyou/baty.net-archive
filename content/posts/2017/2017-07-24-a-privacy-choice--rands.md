[Rands](http://randsinrepose.com/archives/a-privacy-choice/):

> And I’m not even worried about this one meeting. I’m worried about all of the meetings and the collective compounding impact of all the small seemingly inconsequential decisions in a company where the business is selling advertising versus a company where the business is selling product.

I switch to using Chrome once in a while, even though I generally prefer Safari. Chrome has collected all the energy and the ecosystem and is better when doing any sort of web development. This usually lasts about 2 months.

I switched back to Safari again a couple of weeks ago. Privacy concerns are a significant reason, and Rands understands the feeling.
