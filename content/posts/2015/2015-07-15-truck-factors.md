Seeing [mtov][1]&#8216;s post, [Truck-Factor][2] reminded me that many of the apps I've used regularly for years are susceptible to a small number of buses (I prefer "Bus Factor" to "Truck Factor).

My most-used apps, typically, are these…

<ul class="org-ul">
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.eastgate.com/Tinderbox/">Tinderbox</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.devontechnologies.com/products/devonthink/overview.html">DEVONthink</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.zengobi.com/products/curio/">Curio</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://thebrain.com/">TheBrain</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="http://www.barebones.com/products/bbedit/">BBEdit</a>
  </li>
</ul>

Each of these is developed by a very small team, sometimes by only one person. I don't really worry about this. They've all been around a long time and the developers are active and reliable. While I'd disappointed if any of them were to go away (for bus or other reasons), I wouldn't be lost. It may sound cold, but I'd just use something else.
