One of the few complaints I have with OS X is that it seems to deliberately thwart the use of the keyboard for anything other than text entry. What I didn't know was that there's a little checkbox in System Preferences &rarr; Keyboard and Mouse &rarr; Keyboard Shortcuts that says "Turn on full keyboard access"&#8230;

This, although still not quite there, is a **huge** improvement.
