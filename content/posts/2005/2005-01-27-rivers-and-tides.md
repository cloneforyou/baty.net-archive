If someone were to ask me, "What is an artist?" I'd probably just stare blankly and shrug my shoulders. On the other hand, watching [Rivers and Tides][1], a film about Scottish artist Andy Goldsworthy made me want to jump up and down screaming "There's one, right there!"

While the movie was beautifully filmed and scored, the best part was being allowed to sit quietly and marvel at Mr. Goldsworthy's work and his approach to creating each piece. I can't imagine a dedication so strong toward things so ephemeral.&nbsp; I sat with a big stupid grin on my face, head slightly shaking in disbelief while watching him build great, delicate structures, soon only to have them destroyed by tides or sun or wind.
  

  
I watched it alone, and wished immediately that I hadn't. It needed to be talked about.
