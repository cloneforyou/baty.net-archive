I don't think the Adobe buyout of Macromedia has anything to do with Flash. Does Flash actually generate any significant revenue? I admit that I don't really know, but I doubt it. I don't think Adobe gives a tin shit about Flash. It's not like they'll **ignore** it, I just don't think Flash is the reason they're here. Same for Dreamweaver. They were never that interested in making GoLive any better, why will it be any different with Dreamweaver?

I think they're after the enterprise customers that Macromedia is likely much closer to. Flash is probably part of the plan, especially when they stir the PDF and Flash soup for a bit. This is not an original thought, but one I agree with.

And for all of the designers out there crying about the shaky, unknowable future of Dreamweaver &#8211; get over it. If Dreamweaver goes away, there are only 10 or 20 viable alternatives you can use to hack together your web pages. Besides, it's all been downhill in dedicated HTML editors since Macromedia bought Allaire (and so also, Homesite) anyway.

**Update**: Please ignore most of what I just said. I really have no idea what I'm talking about and I'd hate to confuse those who might mistake me for someone who does.
