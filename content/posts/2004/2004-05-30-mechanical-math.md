I love simple mechanical devices. Being a computer nerd makes one appreciate simple things that just work, since most of our time is spent dealing with things that regularly and inexplicably [don't work][1].

Many years ago my dad gave me a [slide rule][2] that he used in school. I've not been able to find it, so I bought another one. It's a KEUFFEL & ESSER something-or-other, because I can't afford the Deci-Lon. I have no idea why, but it's pretty cool though, eh?
