Here's a quick list of my favorite movies from the past year.

### The Hangover

Saw the poster for The Hangover while seeing another movie. Made a mental note to avoid it. I was wrong. Funny from start to finish.

### The Class

Should have been clich&eacute;, but wasn't. It was quiet, real and moving.

### The Hurt Locker

Devastating, tense, thrilling. A character study rather than a "war movie."

### Up!

The first 15 minutes of _Up!_ prove once again that animation can be deeply emotional and SQUIRREL!

### Zombieland

Who know the zombie genre had so much life left in it. Also includes the best cameo ever.

### Inglourious Basterds

Brad Pitt's over the top character was fine, but Nazi Colonel Hans Landa (Christoph Waltz) walked away with every scene he was in. I don't automatically love everything Tarantino does, but I loved Inglourious Basterds.

### Goodbye Solo

Quiet, understated, touching. I was completely engrossed from start to finish.

### Anvil! The Story of Anvil

You don't have to be a Metal fan to enjoy watching Anvil! The Story of Anvil. It's touching, sad and hopeful and funny.

### In The Loop

Fast, hilarious, vicious political satire. This is how wars are made.

### World's Greatest Dad

This dark, perverted, and very funny movie by Bob Goldthwait took me completely by surprise. I've grown to expect less from Robin Williams, but he's terrific here. I guess a little autoerotic asphyxiation brings out the best in people.
