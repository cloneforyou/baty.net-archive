Yes, I know, I switched blogging platforms again. But [Textpattern][1], so far, **feels** so much better than [WordPress][2]. WordPress is nice but it has that built-by-geeks feel to it that can wear on you after a while. I hacked around with the admin area a bit and improved it some, but it felt a lot like swimming upstream.

Textpattern on the other hand feels, well, nice. It's actually more a full-blown content management system than just a weblog tool, but it doesn't suffer from feature bloat &#8211; yet.

Let's see how it goes.
