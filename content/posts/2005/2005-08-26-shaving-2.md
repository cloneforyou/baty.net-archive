Shaving just isn't any fun. I tend to use cheap-ass razors and even cheaper shaving cream that smells like deodorant. I can only shave every other day at a mininum or my neck turns into hamburger. Although annoying, this has never been something I've considered doing anything about. Then, the always valuable [Lifehack][2] posts a link to [A Simple Guide to Shaving][3]. After following a link to [classicshaving.com][4], you just know I'm going to end up with some fancy badger hair brush, double-edge safety razor and an assortment of creams and lotions. But I'll be smooth, baby!
