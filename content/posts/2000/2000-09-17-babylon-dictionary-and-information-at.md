[Babylon Dictionary and Information at your fingertips][1]

With my limited vocabulary, I always wanted a way to quickly find the definition of those really fancy words I'd run across when reading online.
  


Sure, I could copy, type &#8211; <http://www.dictionary.com> &#8211; enter &#8211; paste &#8211; enter &#8211; read. A couple years ago that was cool enough, but of course we learn quickly to take things for granted
  


Along comes [babylon][2] which lets me highlight a word in any application, right click and BLAM!, instant definition with links to multiple related resources.
