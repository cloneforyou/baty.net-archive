My electric kettle stopped working recently, so I decided to make a large format photograph of it before throwing it away.

{{< figure src="/img/2018/02/201802Sunday_Scan1-edit.jpg" title="Electric Kettle. Crown Graphic, HP5+, FF Monobath" >}}

I&#8217;ve used this kettle for a couple of years, but we never got along well. I liked the very controlled pour it allows, but all those buttons just to make some water hot?

I had to pull my tea kettle out of storage, so I made a photo of that, too.

A tea kettle is beautifully simple. You put water in it and set it on a burner. It makes noise when it&#8217;s ready. That&#8217;s it. It can&#8217;t really malfunction or otherwise fail. It has my preferred number of features&#8230; one.

And speaking of simple, I processed these 4&#215;5 negatives in the new FF Monobath. Pour it in, agitate every 30 seconds for 6 minutes, and pour it out. Wash and hang to dry. Very simple.
