An old friend &#8211; noticing that I was sitting in my kitchen alone,
  

  
eating some asian noodles and baked salmon, drinking a glass of wine
  

  
and listening to Etta James &#8211; asked "Since when did you start all of
  

  
this?"

I knew the answer of course, but couldn't bring myself to say it.
