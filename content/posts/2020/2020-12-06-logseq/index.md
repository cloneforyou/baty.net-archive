title: Logseq is a private, local-first Roam alternative
excerpt: This is a pretty compelling local-first option. Written in Clojure and feels more Roam-like than, say, Obsidian.

I continue to follow development of [Logseq](https://logseq.com).

> Logseq is an open-source platform for knowledge sharing and management. It focuses on privacy, longevity, and user control.
> 
> The server will never store or analyze your private notes. Your data are plain text files and we currently support both Markdown and Emacs Org mode

That's right, the files used by Logseq are just a Github repo full of Org mode files. How cool is that?

Here's today's Daily Note so far:

I'm rooting for Logseq. I already prefer it to things like [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md), which I find clunky and unattractive. Whether it becomes compelling enough to be a full-on replacement for my private Roam database remains to be seen.
