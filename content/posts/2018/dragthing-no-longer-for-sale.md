title: DragThing is no longer for sale

<a href="https://dragthing.com/" class="u-like-of" rel="like-of">DragThing is no longer for sale</a>:

> While we have not yet made a final decision, we do not feel comfortable selling an app with an uncertain future, so DragThing is no longer for sale. It should continue to function on 10.14 Mojave for now.

I haven't used DragThing for a long time, but I loved it while I did.
