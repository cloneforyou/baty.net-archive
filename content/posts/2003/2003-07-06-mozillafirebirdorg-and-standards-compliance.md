A week or so ago I registered and created [mozillafirebird.org][1] . It
  

  
was pointed out to me today that since Mozilla Firebird is one of the

most standards-compliant browsers, its web site should probably at
  

  
least validate, which it didn't. I've made changes so that it now
  

  
validates as XHTML 1.0 Transitional. Thanks Andre!
