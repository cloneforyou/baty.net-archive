When did they start making so much excellent software for the Mac? When I left there was like, Quark and Photoshop. Nearly every time I start looking for some utility or other app, I seem to find something that is not only applicable, but pretty damn polished as well. Seem that all the freeware/shareware folks are in some sort of contest to see who's software looks and feels the best. It's a contest that ends up with everybody a winner.

And this [list of software from Mac OS X Power Tools][1] looks like a fine place to start.
