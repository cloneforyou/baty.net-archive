"You don't have to save the photos - they can disappear"

I know that wasn't the point of his post, but dammit I wish people would stop
saying it. You don't have to save _all_ of them, but you sure as hell should
save _some_ of them. Or maybe you don't care that you'll end up with nothing to
show your grandkids.
