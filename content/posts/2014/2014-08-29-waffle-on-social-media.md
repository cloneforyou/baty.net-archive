[Waffle on Social Media][1]:

> My blog’s older than Twitter and Facebook, and it will outlive them. It has seen Flickr explode and then fade. It’s seen Google Wave and Google Reader come and go, and it’ll still be here as Google Plus fades. When Medium and Tumblr are gone, my blog will be here.

(Via [inessential.com][2])

This is exactly how I look at it. I started this blog in 1999 and although it has an audience of nearly zero, I find it invaluable as a public history of what I've been thinking about over time and it is owned by and depends on no one but me.
