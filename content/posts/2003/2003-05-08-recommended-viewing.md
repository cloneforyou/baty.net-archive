Here are a couple films&mdash;I mean "movies"&mdash;that you might like.&nbsp; I certainly did.

    <strong>Jesus' Son</strong> &#8211; Billy Crudup plays "Fuckhead", an almost lovable dufus with a poet's heart and a penchant for heroin. The story follows his unintentional search for sobriety. There are some laugh-out-loud funny moments sprinkled with some harrowing and disturbing bits. Much to like here.

  </div>
  
  <div>
    <strong>No Man's Land</strong> &#8211; Set on the front lines of the Bosnian-Serb conflict, the movie spends most of its time following 3 men (a Serbian and Two Bosnians) trapped in a trench between the lines ("no man's land") This is also a movie with some very funny moments interspersed with violence and trained hatred. It's a pretty powerful drama.
