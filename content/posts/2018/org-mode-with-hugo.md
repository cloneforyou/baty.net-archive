title: Publish Using Org Mode With Hugo
---

I write nearly everything /except/ blog posts using Org-mode. Wouldn't it be
nice to write blog posts with Org-mode, too? It would.

I was perusing the README for [[https://github.com/masasam/emacs-easy-hugo][Easy Hugo]] and I'll be darned if it doesn't support
using .org files automatically. All I need to do is use .org for the filename
when creating a new post. Very nice.
