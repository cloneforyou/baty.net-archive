I&#8217;ve given it a few days but I&#8217;ve decided that <del>I hated</del> I&#8217;m angry with Westworld Season 2.

Bernard&#8217;s constant bewilderment aligned nicely with mine. I should have known better, given its dumb-ass messed up timeline and &#8220;Lost&#8221;-like &#8220;Rules, what rules?&#8221; behavior.

&#8220;You just don&#8217;t &#8216;get&#8217; it!&#8221; you say. You&#8217;re right, and that&#8217;s another reason I hated it. It&#8217;s not a mystery, it&#8217;s sprawling nonsense. Go ahead, pretend it means something if you want. Pretend the &#8220;What does it really mean to be human?&#8221; question is deep. I&#8217;m past that.

This is what I got out of it:

  * Bernard is confused
  * Dolores is mean to everyone
  * The Man in Black falls for the too-quiet-empty town like 12 times and somehow survives
  * No one can die. Or can they?
  * Ford has a plan, but no one knows what it is and they wouldn&#8217;t tell us if they did.

Anyway, can&#8217;t wait for Season 3.
