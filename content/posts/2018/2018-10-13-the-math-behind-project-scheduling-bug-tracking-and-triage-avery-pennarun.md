title: The Math behind Project Scheduling, Bug Tracking, and Triage – Avery Pennarun

[Avery Pennarun | USENIX][1]:

> Many projects have poorly defined (and often overridden) priorities, hopelessly optimistic schedules, and overflowing bug trackers that are occasionally purged out of frustration in a mysterious process called &#8220;bug bankruptcy.&#8221; But a few projects seem to get everything right. What&#8217;s the difference? Avery collected the best advice from the best-running teams at Google, then tried to break down why that advice works—using math, psychology, an ad-hoc engineer simulator (SimSWE), and pages torn out of Agile Project Management textbooks.
