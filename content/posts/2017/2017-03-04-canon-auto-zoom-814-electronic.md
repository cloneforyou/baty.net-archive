There is something special about 8mm movie film. First, it's wonderfully
retro. Beyond that, it's fun to occasionally load into a projector and
show on a big screen. And of course I love the permanence of it. Also,
it's fun.

I bought a cheap Super8 camera a year ago and I like watching at the first reel I shot with it, shown here...

I thought I'd try shooting more movie film, so I bought the above Canon
Auto Zoom 814 Electronic. It was cheap, solid and more than sufficient
for my needs. I'm maybe half way through my first cartridge. I can't
wait to finish and have it processed. The nice part about this camera is
that even if it stops working, it looks cool just sitting on a shelf. I
hope that doesn't happen, of course.
