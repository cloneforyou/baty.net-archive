I just finished my first
[5-Year Journal](http://www.levenger.com/5-Year-Journal-Core-7150.aspx) from
Levenger and I can't recommend it enough.

The idea is to write a short sentence or two each day. The journal is laid out
so that each page contains five entries, one per day for each of the five years.
It's great seeing what I wrote on any given day in prior years. It's easy to
spot things that have changed over time. Better yet, it's easy to spot the
things that haven't.

I bought four of them and now have three left. That's 15 more years of small
daily records. Priceless.
