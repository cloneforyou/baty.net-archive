> Apple has managed to extract peak performance from a pint sized speaker, a feat that deserves a standing ovation. _The HomePod is 100% an Audiophile grade Speaker._

I love how the HomePod sounds, but I have no way to quantify it. I&#8217;ll just link to this instead.

About the automatic room correction:

> To have this sort of thing be a built in feature of the Digital Signal Processing (DSP) inside the speaker that is, for all intents and purposes omnidirectional, allowing it to adapt to any room, no matter how imperfect, is just beyond impressive. What Apple has managed to do here is so crazy, that If you told me they had chalk, candles, and a pentagram on the floor of their Anechoic chambers, I would believe you. This is witchcraft. I have no other word for it.

And for fun, from the comments (seanheis)

> When I heard that Apple was releasing a smart speaker that had been in development for 6 years and could only set one timer at a time&#8230;I knew that it had been properly developed by an audiophile.

Chuckle.
