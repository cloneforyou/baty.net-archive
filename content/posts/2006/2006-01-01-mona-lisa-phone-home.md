I find the following photo (by [Philip Freedman](<http://www.photo.net/shared/community-member?user_id=844952>)) a little depressing.

I'm wondering, why photograph the Mona Lisa? There's probably 6 dozen postcards in the lobby with high quality photos of the painting. Also, using a cell phone will guarantee that the image is going to suck and it will probably end up being deleting anyway. Or is everyone simply going to message friends with a quick "hey, I saw the Mona Lisa! See!"? Could be I'm just pissed I don't have a camera phone, but I think that it's more likely related to a vague sense of discomfort with the way images have become so disposable.
