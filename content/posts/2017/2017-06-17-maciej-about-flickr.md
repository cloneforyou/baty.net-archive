In an interview on The Verge about his recent Delicious
acquisition, [Maciej CegÅ‚owski](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15746916/pinboard-founder-maciej-ceglowski-interview-yahoo-delicious-fandom) says:

> If you could have Flickr back the way it used to be and run competently,

> old Flickr crew could get the site back and run it the way they wanted to.

Oh my, that would make me so happy. 

Maybe if [Amazon does buy Slack](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2017/06/why-would-amazon-want-to-buy-slack/530430/), [Stewart](https://twitter.com/stewart)  will have a little more free time and a
_lot_ more cash. Could happen, right?

Flickr is still my favorite image sharing service. I have optimistically clung
to it in recent years, although I'm not sure I'll be able to get past the
recent Verizon acquisition. Seeing Flickr back in caring, competent hands would be
the ideal outcome.
