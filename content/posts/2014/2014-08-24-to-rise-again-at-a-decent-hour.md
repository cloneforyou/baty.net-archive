[To Rise Again at a Decent Hour: A Novel: Joshua Ferris][2]

I loved “Then We Came to the End” but this latest book by Joshua Ferris didn’t do as much for me. I enjoyed the first half of the book most, during which dentist Paul O'Rourke tried to determine who had created an entire online presence in his name. I identified with Dr. O'Rourke, who is a Luddite addicted to his "me-machine" (iPhone). After that the story veered into a statement on religion and finding oneself and I lost interest during one of the many passages describing Jewish religious history in more detail than I thought necessary. Plus, too much baseball.

I like the way Joshua Ferris writes, and that made it worth reading the book. It just wasn't what I was hoping for.
