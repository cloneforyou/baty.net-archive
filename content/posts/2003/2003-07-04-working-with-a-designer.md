Daniel Will-Harris writes a [great piece][1] about working with a designer. It nicely describes how a client should manage it's relationship to a design firm.



  1. Choose your designer carefully
  2. Leave your preconceived notions at the door
  3. Tell your designer what you want to say rather than how you want it to look
  4. Be clear about specific features you need
  5. Do your research and be specific about your needs
  6. Make sure your message and content are clear
  7. Design for your customer, not yourself, your friends or your colleagues
  8. Have good reasons for your preferences
  9. Don't design by committee
 10. Don't tell your designer how to design
li>You can't please all the people all the time</li> 

  * Trust your designer</ol>
