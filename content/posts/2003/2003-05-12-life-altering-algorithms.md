Mary just reminded me that if it had been up to online dating services,
  

  
we would never have met. We were both experimenting with Match.com at
  

  
the same time (yes, it's true), but were never recommended to each other
  

  
by the site's "recommendation engine". Sure seems like we should've
  

  
been. Oh well, thankfully mutual friends use a better algorithm.
