Seems I can't get enough doomsday fiction these days. Peter Heller's "The Dog Stars" was both heart-wrenching and positive. Starting out as a story about Hig and his dog Jasper surviving the apocalypse and ending as something else, I found it to be at times violent, sad, and beautiful. I'm not sure anyone but Cormac McCarthy is allowed to remove punctuation from dialog, but I got over that.
