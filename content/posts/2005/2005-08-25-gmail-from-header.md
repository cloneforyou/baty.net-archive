I just discovered that one of the few issues I have with Gmail has been fixed. You can now change the "From:" header to something other than your Gmail address. I never liked having my mail come from gmail.com, especially when sending [office][1] email, but the benefits for me outweighed any possible confusion. Just followed [these instructions][2] and all is well.
