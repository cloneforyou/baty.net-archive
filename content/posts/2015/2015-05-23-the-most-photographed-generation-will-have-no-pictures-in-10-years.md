> 2025. You just found that DVD you had in that drawer you couldn’t remember which one it was. Along with 9 old cell phones that no longer will work with today’s new technology. Your 3 inch by 3 inch cube computer no longer has a DVD drive since in 2015 they were totally phased out. Your 3rd grandchild is sitting on your knee and asks to see pictures of their Mom- and all you have to show them is this piece of round plastic that is pretty much worthless. Not to mention dusty and scratched from all those old cellphones moving around every time you opened that drawer. And since Instagram had been merged with another company, and they started charging, you let that go 8 years ago.

I've been saying this for years, the best way to preserve your photographs is to print them.

I know that _my_ digital photos will be around for at least as long as I am, because I'm a nerd and I care deeply about them, but what about after I'm gone? Maybe no one cares and maybe it doesn't matter. I believe it does matter. It matters a great deal.

Just print a few of your photos every year. It'll be worth it.
