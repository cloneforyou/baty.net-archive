Twice recently, after reviewing my referrer logs I noticed a large number of hits from search engines that seemed unlikely. For example, searching for [Leica Photography][1] shows one of my posts on the first page of results. The other is [Used Digital Rebel][2], where I come up in the number one spot. I won't complain, but neither of these makes much sense.
