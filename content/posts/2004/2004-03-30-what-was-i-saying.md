Oops! Noodles are done&#8230; run into kitchen. Lay the noodles out nicely and cover with the meat sauce that took me like three hours to make. I use the term "sauce" loosely, as it ended up with a consistency of say, beef barbeque. Oh well, I finish putting together my very first attempt at real lasagna and head back into the office.

So I wrote this instead.
