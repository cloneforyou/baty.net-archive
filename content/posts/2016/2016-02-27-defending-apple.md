Late last night I found myself arguing with a guy at the bar about the FBI/Apple hubbub.

I expected to swiftly bury him with an expertly-constructed argument damning the FBI and praising Apple for taking a stand against the continuing erosion of our capital-P Privacy etc. etc.

What happened instead is that I sounded like an anti-government conspiracy theorist with an agenda.

I woke up confused.
