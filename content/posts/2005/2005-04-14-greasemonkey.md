I started using [OmniWeb][1] instead of Firefox a couple months ago and so completely missed [GreaseMonkey][2] for Firefox. In case you've been living in my neighborhood (ie a cave) then you should really try it. From the site&#8230;

First thing I did was check out the extensive list of scripts at the [GreaseMonkey Script Repository][3]. So far, my browsing experience has improved in the following ways&#8230;

</p> 

  * GMail's inbox now has a "Delete" button (which Google should've put there from the get go)


  * Flickr's Flash presentation of images (and notes) are replaced with the original jpeg and a lightweight AJAX interface which loads much faster


  * CNN no longer has a column full of Ads (especially the slow-loading, browser-crashing Flash ones)
</ul> 

There are about a hundred more that I've not yet tried, but many of them look **very** useful.
