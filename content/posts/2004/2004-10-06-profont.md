Years ago I used the Programmer's Font on a Mac with BBEdit. It wasn't available for Windows, so when I moved to a Windows box it was back to Courier. A while ago I took another look, but it didn't work in [Vim][1] for some reason.&nbsp; Seems they've solved that and I can see my colons again. [Get ProFont here][2]
