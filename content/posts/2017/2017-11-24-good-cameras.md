In my [previous post about the X-Pro2 and 56mm][1] I wrote, &#8220;I feel like I could actually make some decent images with this combination.&#8221; That sounds suspiciously like a belief that specific gear is required to make a &#8220;decent image&#8221; and could start a whole thing about it&#8217;s-the-photographer-not-the-camera or the best-camera-is-the-one-you-have-with-you trope.

To be clear, I of course believe that a good photographer can make good photos with _any_ camera. But other than to prove a point, who would would want to?

On the other hand, I&#8217;m not a terribly good photographer. I just don&#8217;t have the creative vision for it. I enjoy making photos so this is fine with me. Much of the joy I derive from photography is in playing with various cameras and processes. I can make shitty photos with any old camera, and often do, but I prefer to use good cameras whenever possible.

I love cameras, but what do I mean by a &#8220;good&#8221; camera? For me, a good camera is about how it looks, feels, and functions. By &#8220;feel&#8221; I don&#8217;t only mean touch. I also mean how the camera makes _me_ feel when I&#8217;m using it.

Leica film cameras are my idea of the perfect camera. Picking up a vintage Leica M is a tactile experience that no other camera can replicate. The feel of an M is perfect. The size, shape, texture, and weight are all ideal. Beyond that, there&#8217;s the emotional &#8220;feel&#8221; of a Leica. It&#8217;s impossible for me to separate Leica from its storied history. I&#8217;m sentimental that way, so using a Leica _feels_ good in every way that a camera can.

<figure id="attachment_128" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-128" src="/img/2017/11/20100619_P6190593-edit.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="768" srcset="/img/2017/11/20100619_P6190593-edit.jpg 1024w, /img/2017/11/20100619_P6190593-edit-300x225.jpg 300w, /img/2017/11/20100619_P6190593-edit-768x576.jpg 768w, /img/2017/11/20100619_P6190593-edit-750x563.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Olympus OM-1n</figcaption></figure>

My old, beat up Olympus OM-1n is a good camera. It had fallen down the side of volcano, so the previous owner gave it to me. It was a mess. The bottom plate literally required a hammer to get it back into shape. It&#8217;s tiny and barely works but I always remember where it&#8217;s been and I love it.

<figure id="attachment_130" style="width: 640px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-130" src="/img/2017/11/olympus-stylus-epic.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="512" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Olympus Stylus Epic</figcaption></figure>

And yes, sometimes, a good camera is the one you have with you. I&#8217;ve been carrying a little Stylus Epic, on and off, for years. I paid $10 for the one in the photo. It&#8217;s plastic and cheap, but I love how it _works_. I can reach into my pocket, open the camera, and take a photo with one quick, smooth movement. And I don&#8217;t worry about dropping it. It&#8217;s a very good camera.

<figure id="attachment_131" style="width: 1024px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><img class="size-full wp-image-131" src="/img/2017/11/20171122-1.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="848" srcset="/img/2017/11/20171122-1.jpg 1024w, /img/2017/11/20171122-1-300x248.jpg 300w, /img/2017/11/20171122-1-768x636.jpg 768w, /img/2017/11/20171122-1-750x621.jpg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /><figcaption class="wp-caption-text">Fuji X-Pro2 with Fujinon 56mm f/1.2</figcaption></figure>

And then there&#8217;s the camera that got me thinking about all this again. The Fuji X-Pro2. It handles similarly to a Leica M. It feels good in the hand. The controls are designed and arranged the way I like them. Finally, the images are technically very very good.

When I wrote &#8220;I feel like I could actually make some decent images with this combination&#8221; what I meant was that using the X-Pro2 feels good, works well, and helps me create the kind of photos I enjoy making. Therefore, like the others, it&#8217;s a good camera.
