title: Some text-based things today
---

A couple times a year I find myself in an all-text-for-all-things mood and today was one of those days. This is different from my similar put-everything-in-emacs mood, as it involves neither Emacs nor Org Mode.

So today I dusted off my configurations for the following:

- **[Tmux][1]** - Used for keeping an eye on a bunch of terminal apps at once.
- **[Taskwarrior][2]** - A favorite CLI-based task manager. Powerful yet simple.
- **[WeeChat][3]** - I want to love IRC but I don't use it much lately. Still, it's fun to bring it back once in a while.
- **[jrnl][4]** - Command line journaling. I used this for a while back in 2015 and thought it was time for another look.

And this one is new to me:

- **[twtxt][5]** - A "Decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers." Seemed interesting to try.

The last time a text-based workflow took hold of me was [back in 2015][6]. The wheel turns 'round.
