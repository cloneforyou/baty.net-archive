[This post][1] from Kiko guy Richard White is a healthy read. In it he dispels the idea that once Google (Calendar) got into their game, folding was the only option. Turns out there are a lot of non-Google reasons for Kiko's demise. As usual, I found a quote which relates to the less-is-more attitude I'm so fond of&#8230; 

> Too many features killed the cat. It didn't look it at first, but if you played around with Kiko 1.0 for 15 minutes you found out that there was a \*lot\* of functionality under the hood. Problem was that we felt we needed to bring \*all\* of that functionality over to Kiko 2.0. I mean you can't cut features between versions, right? Wrong. We should have cut features, probably about 40% of them and launched.
