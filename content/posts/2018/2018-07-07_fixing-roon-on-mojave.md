title: Fixing Roon on Mojave beta
---

[Roon](https://roonlabs.com) would not launch after I installed the Mojave
public beta 2 on my iMac. I found [this
thread](https://community.roonlabs.com/t/roon-crashes-on-macos-10-14-mojave-beta/45568/2?u=jack_baty)
on the Roon forums which suggested that I remove and re-add Roon from the list of apps in
the Accessibility list in Security preferences

It worked! Phew.
