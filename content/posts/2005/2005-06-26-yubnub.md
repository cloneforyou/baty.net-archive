I didn't think much of this the day after the one-day Rails competition. I must not have been paying attention, because [YubNub][1] is sweet. It takes a little while to understand why. Bookmark it for a few days, then add one or two of your own commands. You'll get it.

I added "jbsearch" as a command to seach this blog, for no particular reason, but it works just fine.
