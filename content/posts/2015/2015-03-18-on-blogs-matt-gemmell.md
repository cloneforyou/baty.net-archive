[On blogs &#8211; Matt Gemmell][1]:

> Blogs have self-esteem issues.
> 
> Instead of a blog, let your site be a site. Or a journal. An online anthology. Your collected works. Your essays, to date. Your body of writing. A blog is a non-thing; it’s the refusal to categorise what you produce, and an implicit opt-in to the disappointing default. 

Nah. I think instead that many bloggers have developed an inflated sense of self. If I ever refer to something I post here as a “piece” someone should be sure and slap me. I’m fine the way things are. “My collected works” &#8211; gross.
