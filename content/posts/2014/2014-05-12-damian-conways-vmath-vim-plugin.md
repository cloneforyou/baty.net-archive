I'm experiencing my annual urge to return to using Vim full-time. Even though it usually only lasts a week or two, I always have a lot of fun and learn all sorts of new tricks.

For example, I watched David Gamba's [More Instantly Better Vim talk][1] and discovered his [vmath plugin][2] which turns a Vim session into a lightweight spreadsheet ala [Soulver][3]. Put your cursor into a column of numbers, hit "++" and it displays the sum, avg, mean, etc and puts the results in registers so it can easily be put into other areas of the document.

Surprisingly useful

I love playing with Vim. Someday I hope to be so good at it that I don't get lazy
and fall back to BBedit or whatever for everything.
