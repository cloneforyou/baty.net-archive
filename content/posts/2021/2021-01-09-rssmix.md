Some days I worry about having too many blogs and fret about where stuff _should_ go and all that. Other days, today for example, I don't care at all. I suspect that I'll always have a bunch of different blogs. So be it. 

There are a handful of people who actually want to keep up with all of my posts. I'm happy that those people care enough to be annoyed that I'm spread so thin. As a way to help with keeping track of my stuff, I created a consolidated RSS feed at RSS Mix for the following blogs:

- Baty.net (https://www.baty.net/index.xml)
- Baty.blog (https://www.baty.blog/feed.rss)
- Copingmechanism.com (https://copingmechanism.com/rss/)
- Micro.blog (https://micro.baty.net/feed.xml)

This means you can subscribe to just the following RSS feed and you'll see everything I post to my various blogs:

I have no experience with [RSS Mix](http://www.rssmix.com), but hopefully it'll make it a little easier to follow along with my various sites.
