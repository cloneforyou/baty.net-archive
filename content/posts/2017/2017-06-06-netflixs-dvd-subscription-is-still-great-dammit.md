I finally killed my Netflix DVD subscription in 2015[^link]. I've been missing
it. The problem with streaming services for me is that I often end up spending
an hour watching trailers and never actually watching an actual movie.

Being forced to make a decision on what to watch is what I liked about Netflix
DVDs (and Blockbuster).

What if I canceled my streaming services and watched rented DVDs only? That
would make it hard to just lose a weekend binge watching stuff. I also couldn't
spin my wheels watching trailers agonizing over which movie to choose.

Now Karcher has me thinking about getting DVDs in the mail again.
