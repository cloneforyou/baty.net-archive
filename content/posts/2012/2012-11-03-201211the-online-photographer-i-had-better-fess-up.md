> It seems fair to conclude from the evidence that I'm the victim of some persistent delusions when it comes to my own photography. For instance, every time I buy a new camera, I truly believe that I'm going to use it for the rest of my life and will never have to re-sell it. This flies in the face of all of a huge body of evidence to the contrary

That's Mike over at [The Online Photographer][1]&nbsp;admitting the same problem I suffer from. I too buy each new camera with the intention of it being my one-and-only for the rest of my life. That almost never happens. I'm glad it's not just me.
