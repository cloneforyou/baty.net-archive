RSS aggregators are everywhere, and I've used most of them. Eventually I settled on [Feeddemon][1] by the always excellent Nick Bradbury. It's a great piece of software written by a guy who honestly cares about making great tools. But I stopped using it. Why, because as great as it is, it's just another something I have to launch. That means I have to remember I want to read my feeds, then launch yet another app on my already cluttered desktop. It's a small thing, but it's big enough to stop me from doing it.

A few folks recommended [Bloglines][2]. This worked for me because it was in my browser, which is _always_ running. It's always right there so it gets used, never mind the fact that it's a clunky web interface that nowhere near matched FeedDemon's GUI. Strange how that works.&nbsp; Eventually after adding a hundred or so feeds, that web interface just couldn't hold up so I went looking again. That's when I found [Sage][3]. It's a Firefox extension that uses the bookmark manager to organize your feeds. This gives me both the easy and familiar user interface &#8211; bookmarks, along with the immediate and constant availability of a browser-based system. It's a bit buggy yet, but it's already my default aggregator. Once again, simple and convenient trumps fancy and complex. At least for now.
