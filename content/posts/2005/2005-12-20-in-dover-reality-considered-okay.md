A judge in Dover, PA (God love him) rules in favor of reality by making it illegal to teach "Intelligent Design" in classrooms.&nbsp; Our kids may have a chance after all. 

> "To be sure, Darwin's theory of evolution is imperfect," Judge Jones wrote. "However, the fact that a scientific theory cannot yet render an explanation on every point should not be used as a pretext to thrust an untestable alternative hypothesis grounded in religion into the science classroom or to misrepresent well-established scientific propositions."</blockquote> 

And further&#8230; 

> "It is ironic that several of these individuals, who so staunchly and proudly touted their religious convictions in public, would time and again lie to cover their tracks and disguise the real purpose behind the ID Policy."</blockquote> 

Thank you, Judge Jones, from the children.
