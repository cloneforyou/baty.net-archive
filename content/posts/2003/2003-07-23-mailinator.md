[Mailinator][1] is a new service which allows anyone to create throwaway email addresses when they don't want to give a real address, yet need the given address to work. Type in any address, like and you can check any mail sent there by simply entering "foobar" and clicking "Go". No signup, passwords or other nonsense required. Their [FAQ][2] is fun to read and the tagline is "It's like flicking a booger at spam."

[Joel on Software][3] says it's "More proof that great UI design is done by taking away, not adding things."
