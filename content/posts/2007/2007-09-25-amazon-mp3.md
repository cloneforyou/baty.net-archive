If I were Steve Jobs (and I'm not), I would lose a bit of sleep tonight. The [Amazon MP3 store][1] is awesome. Cheaper, almost as easy as iTunes and \*all\* DRM-free. It helps that I love Amazon already anyway. Bought <strike>3</strike> 6 albums so far. The nice and simple downloader app dropped them right into iTunes for me. Unless something bad happens, I go there first from now on.
