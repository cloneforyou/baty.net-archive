[James Jackson Toth (NPR)][1]:

> Missing from a larger discussion is the radical idea that maybe it is the consumers who are being done the greatest disservice, and that this access-bonanza may be cheapening the listening experience by transforming fans into file clerks and experts into dilettantes. I don&#8217;t want my musical discoveries dictated by a series of intuitive algorithms any more than I want to experience Jamaica via an all-inclusive trip to Sandals.

Fine, call it nostalgia but I am firmly in the access-to-music-is-too-easy-to-appriciate-properly camp, even though Toth discovers something a bit different here. I suspect his experiment was flawed.
