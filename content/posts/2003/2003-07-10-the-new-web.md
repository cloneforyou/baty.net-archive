Like it or not, [this][1] is how

corporate web design should and will be done in the future. Take a
  

  
look at the markup and the stylesheet. Excellent on both counts. HTML

weighs in at 9.2K. Validates XHTML Strict. Dual image/text rollovers
  

  
using the :hover pseudo class instead of Javascript. And how the hell

did they get the footer to stay at the bottom where it belongs? A
  

  
wonderful example of forward-thinking design. Oh, and while you're
  

  
there, you might consider actually reading some of the content. It's
  

  
worth it.
