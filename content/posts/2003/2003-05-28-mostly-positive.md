I had one of those reference-quality days today. It started with
  

  
watching my daughter at an academic awards breakfast. Then I finished
  

  
work on a nice, clean tabbed interface implementation and committed it
  

  
nicely into CVS. Following that was a successful test of a new PDF to
  

  
SWF converting web service that I put together using [SWFtools][1] and PHP.
  

  
Then it was on to a successful install of Netjuke to stream all of the
  

  
MP3s on our lan from one location. Oh, and on my way home I dropped an
  

  
Airport Extreme card into a friend's iMac and got all his files
  

  
transferred nicely from the old Win98 machine.

Think I'll just go to bed before the Karma police show up.
