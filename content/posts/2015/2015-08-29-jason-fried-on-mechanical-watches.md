[Jason Fried][1]:

> And then there’s the machine on my wrist. It’s powered entirely by human movement. No batteries, no cables, no daily dependency on the outside world. As long as I’m running, it’s running. And as long as one person checks it out once a decade, it’ll be working as well in 100 years as it works today. It’s better than modern. It’s timeless – yet it keeps time.

Exactly. This is why I enjoy my mechanical watch more than my Apple Watch by quite a wide margin.
