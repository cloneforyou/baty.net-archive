Timeline&#8230;.

**Oct 1st &#8211; Nov 7th 2004**

Wait patiently for the release of Delicious Monster's [Library][2]

**Nov. 8th, 9:00am**

Receive email notification that Library is shipping and ready for download. Too bad I'm on my PC at the office.

**Nov 8th, 7:45pm**

Download the demo and poke around a bit. It's nice, maybe a tad slow.

**Nov 8th, 8:00pm**

Hook up digital video camera to iMac and turn it on.

**Nov 8th, 8:05pm**

Hold barcode on randomly selected book in front of digital camera, wait 5 seconds and then listen as the name of the book is spoken by the computer, and watch as a high-res image and detailed information is automatically entered into Library.

**Nov 8th, 8:06pm**

Giggle aloud, yell for Jess to "Check this out, bring a DVD!"

**Nov 8th, 8:10pm**

Enter credit card number in order form to buy license for Library. I've _already_ had $40.00 worth of fun and I'm just started!

**Nov 8th, 8:10pm-??pm**

Scan everything in sight
