The above screen capture is what my Mail.app inbox looks like this morning. [Letterbox](http://harnly.net/software/letterbox/) is used for the wide view, 2-line subject/from combination, and hairline divider between panes. [Mail Act-On](http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html) lets me use keystrokes for everything message-related. I then hide the toolbar and mailboxes.

Makes for a nice, pretty, and minimal email experience.
