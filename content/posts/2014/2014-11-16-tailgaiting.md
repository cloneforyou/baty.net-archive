I’m not a sports fan, but I apparently don’t mind drinking beer in a giant parking lot with thousands of people who _are_&nbsp;sports fans. With that in mind we braved the 25-degree weather in South Bend for a Notre Dame tailgating party. This was a first for me.

Sports fans are obnoxious, but they sure love it. It’s almost an infectious feeling. Almost.
