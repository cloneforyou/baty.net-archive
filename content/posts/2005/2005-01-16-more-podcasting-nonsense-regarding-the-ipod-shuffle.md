[Apparently][1], the 7 people on the planet who care deeply about podcasting are complaining that the iPod Shuffle isn't suited for it. Good lord. Who cares? There are two reasons for not caring. First, podcasting is silly. Have you ever actually listened to a podcast? They're almost universally useless, mainly because podcasters only talk about podcasting. That's a very boring closed-loop-incest-fest if you ask me. And second, Apple makes plenty of iPods that **are** useful for listening to podcasts. Buy one of those instead.

Who said that every device Apple makes has to confirm to every niche usage pattern? No one, that's who.
