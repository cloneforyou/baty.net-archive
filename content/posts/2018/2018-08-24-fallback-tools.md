It&#8217;s fun to try new things. I experience a strong fear of missing out when it comes to gear and software, so I try almost everything. What if that other thing is better? I should try it!

The New Thing is always fun and interesting, and it some cases I decide that I no longer need the Old Thing and go all in.

Then it happens. I stumble over some missing feature or unanticipated side effect so decide to fall back to the thing I know. The Old Thing. Sometimes it&#8217;s only to get over the current hurdle, but most of the time I end up staying with my old standbys. My fallback tools.

Software examples are: BBEdit, Apple Notes, OmniFocus, Apple Mail, Tinderbox, DEVONthink, and Curio. For photography gear it&#8217;s a Leica M6, Fuji X100T, Tri-X, HC-110, and 5&#215;7 RC paper.

I&#8217;m [currently trying Capture One again][1] for image management and editing. My fallback tool is Lightroom, so we&#8217;ll see what happens there.

Experimenting with new tools is my favorite meta hobby, but it&#8217;s good to know there are things I can always count on.
