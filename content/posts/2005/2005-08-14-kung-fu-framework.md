I've been quiet about [Ruby on Rails][1] &#8211; reluctantly, suspiciously quiet. Why, because _everyone_ else is making so much noise there's not much else for me to say. I will sum up: After several months and several "real" projects, it completely rocks. Just listen to me say, "Woah, I'm never touching PHP/ASP/ColdFusion again &#8211; ever." a dozen times a day and it becomes obvious that Rails is an absolute joy to use.

What about adoption in the marketplace? Who cares!? If I were looking to have an application built and heard a potential vendor's developers raving and giggling about their new favorite framework, I'd hire them without even knowing its name.

A favorite quote (the author of which I've forgotten),
