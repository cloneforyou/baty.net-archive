Tony Buzan invented the concept of "Mind Mapping" in the 1970s after studying how we use our brains to learn, store and recall information. I've flirted with it a few times, with mixed results. Other areas of my life have benefited from an increasingly visual representation, so this weekend I finally got around to reading Buzan's [The Mind Map Book][1]. The book is full of what appears to be science, but I doubt that's what it is. Either way, I'm going to give it a go and see if there's any basis for the hype.
