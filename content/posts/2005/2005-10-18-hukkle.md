It's possible I might have enjoyed myself by renting something other than [Hukkle][1] tonight, but I doubt it. The film is Hungarian, although that doesn't matter because it is almost entirely wordless so you won't have to read anything. But you **will** listen to it, because the sound is amazing. And you won't take your eyes from it because the visuals are stunning. And, although it moves rather slowly, you'll pay attention because it's breathtaking. The sudden perspective shifts are both jolting and perfectly natural. There are all sorts of circle-of-life type things going on, much preparation and eating of food, bugs, animals, dirt, pig testicles and quite possibly a murder. And oh yeah, hiccups &#8211; lots of &#8216;em. It's marvelous.
