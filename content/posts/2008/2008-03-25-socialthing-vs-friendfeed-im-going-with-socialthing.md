[FriendFeed][1] has all the social network aggregation momentum right now, and it's a pretty sweet service. Here's my quick and dirty opinion on FriendFeed vs [Socialthing!][2]

**Like about FriendFeed:** Tons of services are available to connect to. Has an <span class="caps">API</span> available.

**Don't like about FriendFeed:** I have to add each "friend" individually, most of them imaginary. And just _look at it_&#8230;

[Socialthing!][3] is still in private beta, but works much more to my liking. 

**Like about Socialthing!** I add **services** instead of people, and everyone shows up automatically. And _just look at it_&#8230;

**Don't like about Socialthing!:** Fewer available services (but all the ones that matter to me.) Beta is too private. They've reduced the number of invites due to (I assume) traffic pains and so I can't share the love as much as I'd like.

My vote: Socialthing! Now they just need to pull in more services and go public beta on us so everyone can compare the two services themselves.
