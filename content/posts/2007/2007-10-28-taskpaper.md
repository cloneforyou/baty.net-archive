I've been using OmniFocus for a while as my GTD weapon of choice and it's a lovely app. As a matter of fact it is too much of a lovely app. OmniFocus is one of those things that makes it fun to tweak and play endlessly. That there's the problem; I'm guilty of playing with the system rather than using it. Again. 

Enter Hog Bay Software's [TaskPaper][1].

This thing is basically a formatting engine/UI wrapped around simple text files. It's so simple that it actually stands a chance of helping me Get Things Done rather than Puttering With My GTD App. See here&#8230;

Easy eh? I just paid the paltry $18.95 registration fee. If you are like me and use GTD as an excuse to \*not\* GTD, try TaskPaper. Sometimes simpler is better.
