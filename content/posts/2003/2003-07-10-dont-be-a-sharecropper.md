[Tim
  

  
Bray explains][1] what it means to be a sharecropper in the sofware
  

  
development world.

Then goes on to argue that applications running in a web browser are
  

  
_more_ usable that those running on the desktop.

A significant reason for the mass migration to browser-based apps was
  

  
not that the browser was intrinsically better or more usable, but
  

  
instead because there was suddenly an abundance of apps, and most of
  

  
these magical new things ran _only_ in a browser. Although I do
  

  
think that web-based apps are simple and consistant, making them
  

  
easier to use than many of the so called "rich-client" apps out there.
