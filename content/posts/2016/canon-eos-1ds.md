At nearly 15 years old, one might think it would be time to retire the 2002
Canon EOS-1DS in my closet. Not quite yet!

I've always really liked the files from the camera, so I pulled it out today,
charged the giant, clumsy battery, and shot a few snaps around the yard. 

I think it holds up quite well.
