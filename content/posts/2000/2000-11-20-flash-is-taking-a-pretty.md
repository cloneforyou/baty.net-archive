Flash is taking a pretty serious beating by the usability community. Rightly so, in most cases. Suprisingly, Macromedia is reacting to it in a way that may actually benefit users. Below is a post on behalf of Macromedia's Product Manager, Erik Larson.

Hi Everybody,
  


I've been following this list along with several of my colleagues here
  

  
at Macromedia for the past few months, particularly the (rather long
  

  
string of Flash-related posts. I thought you might be interested to see
  

  
an early draft version of our Top 10 Tips for Flash Usability that we
  

  
plan to promote to the 500,000+ Flash developers around the world.
  


We are intensely focused on our customers' needs, and are very
  

  
interested to hear your feedback concerning these tips. We believe Flash
  

  
can be used to create outstanding user experiences, and that guidance
  

  
like these tips will help designers to find their own balance of art and
  

  
engineering while still being free to innovate and explore this evolving
  

  
medium.
  


What do you think?
  


I recommend that you reply directly to me,



, so we
  

  
don't overwhelm Keith and William with another flood of Flash posts .
  

  
I will then post a summary of the responses.
  


Thanks for the excellent discussion!
  


Cheers,
  


Erik
