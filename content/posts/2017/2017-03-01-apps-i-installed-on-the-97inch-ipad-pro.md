title: Apps I Installed On The 9.7-inch iPad Pro
---


Whenever I get a new device I set it up “from scratch”. In doing so, I
figure I’ll be avoiding all of the cruft and nonsense that accumulates
over time. I imagine installing a half-dozen or so non-Apple apps and
THAT’S IT!

It never works out that way.

Here are the apps I installed within the first hour of owning the
smaller iPad Pro, and the list has grown since then.
