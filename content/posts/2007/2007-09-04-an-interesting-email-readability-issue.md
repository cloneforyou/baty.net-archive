I've sent a couple emails recently which contained everything the recipient needed, and yet were completely misread. In both cases, I included the important bits in the very first line, which was promptly ignored. They looked something like this&#8230;

My immediate and completely unscientific conclusion is that one should never include valuable information in the first line of an email. Stick with "Dear so-and-so," or "Hi," instead.
