title: Fewer of more
---

I'd like to have fewer of more things. Does that make sense? Right now
I have five of everything and it's driving me nuts.

I know, I know, I'm the type of person who likes to try different
things; to have options, but that may be changing. At least it feels like
it's changing. It could very well be just another short-lived mood,
but I'm tired of making decisions.

Here are some of the things I'm working on having fewer of.

**Software**. I use way too many apps. They overlap in various ways that
make it impossible to decide which to use for what. I switch between
them and then need to "refactor my workflow" on a monthly basis. As
fun as it is to play with software, my state of mind is telling me to
cut back.

How do I do that? By using Emacs. When I'm in the mood for
easy/pointy/clicky software, I try quitting Emacs. Doing so requires
that I find apps to replace all the things that Emacs had been doing,
and I'm back in the 3-apps-for-each-task conundrum. So now I'm using
Emacs and Org-mode for everything that makes sense.

Using Emacs eliminates the need to decide between the following:

-   Things or OmniFocus for tasks
-   Tinderbox or Apple Notes or TheBrain or DEVONthink or Bear or Ulysses for notes
-   Timings or Timular for time tracking
-   BBEdit or VSCode or Vim for text editing
-   Mail.app or MailMate for email
-   TiddlyWiki or TheBrain or Tinderbox or DEVONthink for project/client
    notes

And so on.

**Notebooks**. I love paper notebooks, but deciding which to carry or use
 is debilitating. I'm down to three: A Field Notes pocket notebook for
 away-from-computer capture, A Leuchtturm for my version of Bullet
 Journal, and a Hobonich Techo for calendar and date-based stuff. Yes,
 that's still three notebooks but it's down from five or six. I'll
 miss the Midori and the Rotterfaden but I have to stop trying to use
 them all at once.

**Cameras**. Admit it, there's no way I'm going to stop using a bunch of
different cameras. I don't know how to addres this yet, but I spend
way too much time organizing cameras and bags to get my "kit" _just
right_.

The smartest move would be Leica M6 for everyday film, Fuji X-T3 for
digital, and the Hasselblad for "serious" work. But then the beautiful
Leica M4 shows up and what about the big Speed Graphic? And that Leica
Q is amazing. Still thinking about this one.

**Clothing**. My least favorite thing is picking out an "outfit" to
wear. I don't think I could pull of a Jobsian uniform, but I'd like to
not spend 15 minutes wondering what goes with what today. I'm working
on getting my wardrobe down to a few types of things, all in simple
colors that work together. Not there yet.

**Devices**. There's no way I need all of the computers/tablets/phones I
have. Two iPads? Two laptops? Two iMacs?. C'mon. This should be easy,
but I love the iPad mini for most things, but the big iPad Pro is
great for watching shows and doodling with a Pencil. And I'm sure I
can find a good use for that "extra" iMac. I don't need it, but there
it sits, taking up my bandwidth.

**Blogs**. I've been getting better at this, but still have too much/many
blogs. I want only one or two so I don't have to think about where to
post what.

**Photo Sharing**. I post photos to Flickr, SmugMug, Instagram, Coping
Mechanism, Micro.blog, and Baty.net. That's nuts. I would like to pick
one for my photo gallery "home" and one for social sharing. Can't
decide, and it's crazy-making.

I could probably call all of this an attempt at "Minimalism" but I
stopped using that word once it had been usurped by so-called
"Productivity Gurus" and "Life Coaches". Blech, time for a new word.

Anyway, the gist is that I want to significantly reduce the number and
types of decisions I have to make every day.
