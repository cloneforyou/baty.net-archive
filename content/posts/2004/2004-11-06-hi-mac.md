Time for a change.

![][1]

It's been a few days since I got my new iMac, which might explain why it's been quiet around here this week. I've been spending as many waking moments as I can getting used an entirely new OS. I haven't used a mac regularly for a long time and I thought it was time to come back for a few reasons&#8230;

</p> 

  * Most of my development work is now targeted toward Linux/Apache/MySQL/PHP, and OS X _is_ unix, which feels more and more like home. I spend most of my productive time in a terminal using [VIM][2] or [Mutt][3] or [Firefox][4], which all run lovely on OS X.


  * The software is getting better. There are an awful lot of Ubergeeks using OS X. Those are the folks that make tools which make life on a computer better. Not only that, but many of the cool things that run on Linux are easily portable to the Mac.


  * Most importantly, I was simply getting bored with Windows.
</ul> 

So after a few days getting to know this thing&#8230;.

**Hardware**

</p> 

  * The iMac is georgeous. I didn't like the new flat-looking things at first. Thought they were boring. After having it on my desk for a bit, I now think it's the best looking most elegant computer I've ever used.


  * The screen is fab. 20" of bright, sharp beauty. I could stare at this thing all day, and probably will.


  * I can't believe Apple won't admit that a 1-button mouse is a bad idea.
</ul> 

**Software**

</p> 

  * Two things: Expose and [Quicksilver][5]. These two alone make it worth dumping Windows. I spent about 20 minutes just making my windows disappear and reappear in all sorts of interesting ways. "Hey Jess, watch this!" I then went into an epileptic fit and had to stop.


  * Installing apps is really too easy. I spent a while trying to find what I _must_ have missed. There's no way you just drag an icon to your Applications folder, is there?


  * Why can't I resize windows using all sides. Hitting that little corner on the lower right is sucking up valuable minutes of my life.


  * When I close all of the windows of an app, the app still hangs around doing nothing but eating RAM. Command-Q is becoming the keyboard shortcut of choice.


  * The Finder kinda sucks. I'm so used to using Directory Opus on Windows that the anemic, slow and goofy Finder interface is more trouble than it's worth. I hope I either get used to it or someone writes a worthy replacement.


  * The applications are, for the most part, wonderful. Someone has been improving things while I was gone. Even the little freeware utilities feel polished and professional.
</ul> 

I'm hooked. My PCs are soon to be moved to an unused corner of my desk for use only when I need to do some SQLServer work or for testing web apps in IE. Good riddance.

I tend to get a little, uh, involved when I find something new, so this particular blog might get a tad Mac-centric for a bit. I'll get over it soon enough.
