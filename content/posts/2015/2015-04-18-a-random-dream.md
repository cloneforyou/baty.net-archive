Last night was full of dreams. The one I remember went like this.

Gail and I were sitting in small chairs against the wall of a plainly-decorated hotel room. We were talking with another woman seated to our right. We were waiting for something.

A large, olive-skinned man stepped into the room. He said nothing, but began to burp. His burps were loud, deep, and disgusting. Gail struggled to avoid vomiting from the sounds.

After several minutes the man stopped, cleared his throat, and turned to me. He looked at me solemnly and said, “On the 3rd birthday of my second daughter I will pay you handsomely for that” and walked away.

Dreams are cool.
