I have built dozens of web app administration areas which consist basically of a table/search/add interface. Adding the ability to sort the table by clicking on a column header is something I frequently leave out. Why? Because it's a PITA. [Jeremy][1] recently pointed me to [SortHelper][2], a simple Rails helper which makes implementing sortable tables just cake. Now I'll need to find a different excuse.
