I thought I was [serious this time](/2019/burning-down-the-other-blogs/), but I really do prefer posting using Blot to Hugo.

This means I'm once again writing primarily at https://www.baty.blog/ and https://rudimentarylathe.org/

RSS feed for the blog is https://www.baty.blog/feed.rss

See you there.
