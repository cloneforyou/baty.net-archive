title: Whatâ€™s In A GIF?
url: /2005/whats-in-a-gif/
---

At lunch a few weeks ago, [Matthew][1] mentioned that he was interested in the GIF file format. I had no idea _how_ interested &#8211; until now. He's written an extensive document, [What's in a GIF][2] which will tell you everything you need to know about GIFs &#8211; and more. Only thing missing is the final word on how to pronounce "GIF".
