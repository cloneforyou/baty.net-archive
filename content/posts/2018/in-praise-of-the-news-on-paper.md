[Barton Swaim, WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/in-praise-of-the-news-on-paper-1523817821):

> The newspaper brings a kind of epistemological definition to the everyday work of being literate. You can hold the day’s knowledge with two ink-stained hands, and when you’re done with it, you can throw it away. It won’t update and demand to be read in a few hours, and it won’t follow you around on your smartphone.

I'm convinced that reading the news "in the paper" is the best way to stay informed without losing one's mind or dying of anxiety in the process. It feels great to be _done_ with the news for the day.
