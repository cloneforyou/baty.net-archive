[Flickr][1] gets most of the community buzz, which is fine, I love Flickr. But, if you're not so much into the community part of things, and still want a nice place to keep your photos, don't forget about things like [SmugMug][2] and [Zoto][3]. I used to have a SmugMug account, but let it lapse. It seems they've added some pretty nice features for creating clean web galleries so it might be worth another look. And Zoto, which I just discovered, is a very slick alternative to Flickr with deep and easy tagging, 2 gig storage, an API and blogging features.
