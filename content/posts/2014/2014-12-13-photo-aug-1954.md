This is one of the few photos from my grandfather’s photo albums without a detailed caption written the reverse. It says simply, “Aug 1954”. I love it.

The woman with the beach ball is playing catch with another woman who is out of frame. The man watches the second woman until his wife has had enough and snatches the binoculars away from him. At least that’s how I imagine it.
