Turns out that there are some avid Stanley Kubrick fans at [the office][1]. [Ryan][2] has seen every movie (but one) that he's ever directed. [Dan][3] hadn't seen The Shining, and rented it after hearing our reviews during lunch. He's been raving about it ever since and already knows more about it than most.

Due in March, [The Stanley Kubrick Archives][4] looks like a great book. At $200, I'm going to taking donations at work in order to buy it.
