[][1]Anyone have any suggestions as to readers for PalmOS devices? I've got [iSilo][2], which I like for HTML docs. Also, iSiloWeb has replaced [AvantGO][3] for me. Much faster and smaller. I'm evaluating [TomeRaider][1] also, for larger reference works. Using the desktop version, I've got the entire Internet Movie Database at my fingertips.
