When I was a kid lunch boxes were important. Even so, I can't remember exactly
which ones I've had. I found these at a local sale so bought them all. The only
one I'm certain I _didn't_ have is Rambo, since I'd graduated from High School
by the time First Blood was released. I'm pretty sure I'd stopped carrying a
lunch box by then.

I fully intend to clean these up and use them to bring my lunch to work.
