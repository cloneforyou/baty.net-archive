I occasionally switch back to using Apple Mail, thinking it will be better than Gmail this time. The concept is there. It's a native app, integrates with every other \_real\_ OS X app. I really like the \_idea\_ of it, but it never sticks. Trying again over the weekend to see how it goes. [Mail Act-On](http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html) will probably help, but I want single-key interaction like Gmail offers. Still looking for a plugin or something that will let me do that.

Let's see.
