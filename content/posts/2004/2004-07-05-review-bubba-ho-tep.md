On rare occasions, [T.M.][1] is wrong about a movie. His contempt for [Bubba Ho-Tep][2] is one of those occassions.

Elvis and JFK didn't die, they live in a Nursing home somewhere in Texas. This particular nursing home also happens to be haunted by an ancient Egyption mummy who's sucking the souls from the residents. Who but The King and The Pres could possibly be capable of stopping it?

It's bizarre, funny, corny and even touching.
