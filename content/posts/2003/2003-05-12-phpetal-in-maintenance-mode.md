I’m officially putting [PHPetal][1] in maintenance

mode. It does everything I need it to do and most of the really ugly

bugs are gone. I have a number of ideas and even some additional code

and patches, but I just don’t have the time to implement completely.

Feel free to send me patches and if they make sense and don’t disrupt

existing code too much I’ll try to find time to roll them in.
