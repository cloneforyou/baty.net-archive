[AskTog: If They Don't Test, Don't Hire Them][1]

Tog again, and he gives 5 great reasons why user testing can improve both the product and the process.

He says, "We&#194;'ve all been to those project team meetings where perhaps ten $100/hr engineers, designers, and marketing people sit around and debate how users are likely to respond. That&#194;'s $1000 an hour for uninformed opinion. One usability professional, applying the scientific method, can have a real answer in two hours for a tiny fraction of that amount. Not only that, it will be the right answer"
