title: Things I'm doing now

A few of the things I’m doing as of **Sunday, September 6, 2020**

- Back in Living in [the wiki](https://rudimentarylathe.org) after a diversion using a public [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) database. formerly maintained on
- Experimenting with the idea of bringing back [TheBrain](https://thebrain.com) as my goto for recording things
- Using [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com/) again for galleries
- Oh yeah, we sold [the company](https://fusionary.com/), so I’m now a consultant there, 3 days a week. It’s weird, but exciting.
