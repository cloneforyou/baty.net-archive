If I had time, I'd learn to develop GUI apps using PHP and XUL as described in  <a>title=</a> phpPatterns() &#8211; Connecting XUL Applications with PHP">this phpPatterns() article</a>. It's cool, but relatively unknown technology. And with namespaces like xmlns="http://www.mozilla.org/keymaster/gatekeeper/there.is.only.xul", the developers are obviously a helluva lot of fun.
