I don't consider myself especially creative, but I enjoy those who are. One of the things we struggle with around the office is how to be creative &#8211; as a team. I tend to believe that creativity is not a team event. A group of people can work together to help bring creative things to life, but I believe that creative genius is typically the work of single &#8211; sometimes two &#8211; individuals. I very much enjoy this quote by David Ogilvy&#8230;

"Search the parks in all your cities, you'll find no statues of committees."
