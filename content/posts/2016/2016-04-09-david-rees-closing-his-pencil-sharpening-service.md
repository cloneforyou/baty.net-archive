David Rees started an [Artisanal Pencil Sharpening][1] service and kept a mostly straight face about it the entire time. The execution was brilliant. Of course I bought one:

He wrote a book on the subject: "[How to Sharpen Pencils][2]"

<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-5110" src="/img/2016/04/how-to-sharpen-pencils.jpg" alt="how-to-sharpen-pencils" width="150" height="220" />

Chapter 11 of "How to Sharpen Pencils" includes an in-depth discussion on mechanical pencils, which is included here in its entirety:

> Mechanical pencils are bullshit.

The book is filled with terrific and useful information about pencil sharpening. I recommended his service to all my friends. I can only assume each and every one of them purchased his or her own pencil.

So it was with surprise and what I can only describe as horror that I read the following tweet:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="550">
  <p lang="en" dir="ltr">
    Wanted to wait until the markets closed so as not to cause panic. Rumors are true, my pencil sharpening biz is effectively done
  </p>

I see that he's changed the price of newly-sharpened pencils from $40 to $500, which could be why he says "effectively done". The good news is that you _could_ still get one. At least for now.

A professionally-sharpened pencil isn't just a tool, it's an investment.
