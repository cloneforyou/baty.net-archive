Valente</a><br/>
My rating: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/2772978272">2 of 5 stars</a><br /><br />
I imagine Catherynne Valente thought to herself...<br /><br />"I think I'll write something sort of like Douglas Adams, but with MORE!"<br /><br />If you throw a lot of words at me, all trying to be super funny, a few of them will land. But when you do it in every single sentence with no guidance at all from an actual plot or characters, it becomes exhausting. So exhausting, in fact, that I stopped reading about 2/3rds of the way through.
