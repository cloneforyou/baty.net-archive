It seems like everything I do requires additional, mostly unnecessary work after I do it.

For example:

When I finish a book I update [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259384-jack-baty), record it in my [media log](https://snippets.baty.net/2017/1021/), and sometimes write a quick blog post about it.

After watching a movie I add it to [letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/jackbaty/), also record it in my media log, and make sure it's properly cross-posted everywhere via [IFTT](https://ifttt.com).

Once I've finished a roll of film or imported an SD card I scan, edit, caption, export, and upload to one or more of [SmugMug](https://jackbaty.smugmug.com), [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/jbaty), [my photoblog](https://photos.baty.net), or [Instagram](https//instagram.com/mrjackbaty), and in the case of film, I make a contact print in the darkroom and carefully file away the negatives.

Sometimes I wonder if the only reason I do things is so that I can share them. That's a depressing thought.

It's exhausting. Can't I just enjoy doing (and having done) the thing without spending so much time making sure there's a public record of it?
