The Great Flash Debate continues to spark [interesting conversations][1]. I'm sort of walking the fence on this one. I love the idea of Flash, but so far hate 95% of the implementations. It's still unusable in most cases and doesn't behave as it should. Most Flash use is still in the "look what I can do" category. I've got no use for that. Most other normal people don't either. The above article says:
  


> Even sites that avoid the invidious splash screen can fall victim to Flash and Shockwave animations that leave you less likely to ask, "How did they do this and how can I hire them?" than "Why did they do this and how can I make it stop?"

I know the feeling.
