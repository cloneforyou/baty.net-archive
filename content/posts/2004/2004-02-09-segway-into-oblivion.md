Prediction: The Segway, as mobile as it is, will never go anywhere. I've always been a closet doubter, but also secretly hopeful that it would catch on. No signs of that happening yet.

According to a  <a>Disney turns away visitors on Segways </del> Feb. 9, 2004" href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/02/09/disney.nosegways.ap/index.html">CNN.com article</a>, Disney is turning them away, even when ridden by paraplegics. Maybe disabled folks should ride one of Kamen's [other wheelchairs][1] instead.
