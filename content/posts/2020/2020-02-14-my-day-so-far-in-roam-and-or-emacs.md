A quick rundown the chaos in my head around&nbsp;[Roam][1]&nbsp;and Emacs and how it has affected my day so far.

**6:00am**&nbsp;Realize on the way to work that Roam just isn’t a great idea for holding my (hopefully) long-term “second brain”. $30/month forever in a proprietery blah-de-blah? Nope, and by the way&nbsp;[org-roam][2]&nbsp;is perfectly suited for this. I want long-term stability and control for this sort of thing and what could be more long-term-stable than Emacs and plain text files, right?

**7:00am**&nbsp;Tweak Emacs a little and settle in. Move some of the things I “accidentally” wrote in Roam yesterday into org-roam. You see? Now&nbsp;_everything_&nbsp;is in Emacs and I can stop thinking about it. This will be fine.

**11:00am**&nbsp;After spending 90-minutes down a rabbit hole trying to get better at managing tables in Org mode and then fumble-fingering a couple commands that messed up my file because my Emacs keybindings are a mess, I decided that NO! maybe Emacs isn’t the best tool for the job and Roam is&nbsp;_made for this_, for crying out loud. Also, Airtable is great at spreadsheets, why suffer the pain (and admit it, it’s painful) of tables in Org mode when I can just paste an Airtable link into Roam? Best tool for the job, yada yada.

**11:30am**&nbsp;Go to lunch and think about all this the entire time even though I just want to enjoy my damn lunch.

**1:00pm**&nbsp;Quit Emacs in anger and put all my notes from this morning into Roam and my tasks into OmniFocus where they belong. Right!? Tasks are way simpler in OmniFocus anyway and it hooks right into email and so on. My second brain is basically useless when it’s nothing more than a bunch of text files. Notes need to be&nbsp;_used to be useful_. They aren’t useful if they are just written once and forgotten. You know what makes my notes useful and is nice and easy to use? Roam!

**2:00pm**&nbsp;Realize I’m doing it again. I kind of knew I was, but now it’s become obvious so I jump into another tab and start writing so I can share this nonsense with everyone because everyone wants to read post after post of me whining about how indecisive I can be.

**The Future**&nbsp;No one knows, the day’s not over yet!
