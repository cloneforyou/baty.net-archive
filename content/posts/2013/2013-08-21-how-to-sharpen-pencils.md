When David Rees started an "Artisanal Pencil Sharpening" service I laughed right along with everyone else. Secretly though, I wished I had thought of it. In his book, "[How to Sharpen Pencils][1]," Rees describes in great detail every possible component of artisinal pencil sharpening; both real and imagined. It's funny. And for those of us who love pencils, it's helpful too. He is, after all, "The number 1 #2 pencil sharpener."
