Spent an hour today wandering around in the [Corner Record Shop][2]. Ended up taking home a rather varied selection of new (and old) records.

  * **J. Geils Band &#8211; Full House**. "First I Look At The Purse" is so great.
  * **Tubular Bells &#8211; Mike Oldfield**. Used in The Exorcist. Makes it creepy
  * **Kill Bill Volume II soundtrack**. I love the music Tarentino chooses for his films.
  * **Red Hot Chili Peppers &#8211; Blood Sugar Sex Magik**. A necessary edition to the vinyl collection
  * **Miles Davis &#8211; Kind of Blue**. Mine was scratched. This one is brand new.
  * **Patti Smith &#8211; Horses**. Remastered. One of my favorites.
  * **Jack White &#8211; Blunderbuss**. Jack White has staying power. This is a great record.
  * **Allen Ginsberg &#8211; Ginsberg sings William Blakes "Songs of Innocence and Experience"**. Weird.
  * **George Michael &#8211; Faith**. Admit it, this is pretty awesome.

So much music!
