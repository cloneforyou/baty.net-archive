After several interesting email-related discussions this week on [Micro.blog][1], I was reminded of [MailSteward][2]. I like the idea of having a local copy of all my email, and I&#8217;ve done this before with tools like mbsync but decided to buy MailSteward as an easier way to maintain a searchable, up-to-date email archive.

MailSteward worked great. It&#8217;s not the prettiest app on my Mac, and $49 might seem steep to some for a such a utility, but I think it&#8217;ll turn out to be worth it.
