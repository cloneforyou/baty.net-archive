While some would call it a bit early, I'm sticking with and moving to MySQL for everything I possibly can. Just like the [press release says][1], "it will now be easier for you to obtain approval from your
  

  
management and customers to use MySQL in mission-critical projects. SAP is
  

  
trusting MySQL AB with their database needs, so why shouldn't everyone?"
