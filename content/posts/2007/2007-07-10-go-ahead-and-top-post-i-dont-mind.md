Back when Usenet was relevant, top-posting was evil. In mailing lists it still is to some degree. However, when you and I are emailing each other, top-posting is perfectly fine. In fact, it's preferred. This cute but misguided example is often used to demonstrate just how awful top-posting is&#8230; 

A: No 

Q: Should I include quotations after my reply? 

If someone else wrote the "Q:" part I get it. Trouble is, 99.9% of the time I'm communicating directly with one other person, and in that case I \*just wrote the god damned question\* so I don't need to read it again for context. People have been debating this for centuries (almost) and brilliant fellas such as John Gruber [completely disagree with me][1]. "Uncouth and illiterate?" Not really. 

And a message to geeks everywhere&#8230; It's perfectly okay to evolve.
