title: Almost Switched to Wordpress Again
---

You may have noticed that for the past 24 hours this site reverted to the old
Wordpress installation. That's because it did revert to the old Wordpress
installation. Looking at all of the necessary supporting infrastructure needed
for Wordpress reminded me why I prefer a static site. I came to my senses and
switched it back to Hugo and Netlify.

That may have been the fastest waffling I've done yet.
