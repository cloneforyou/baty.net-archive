Jessica came home excited to show me that one of her photos was published in a nearby local newspaper. She'd shown me the photo earlier and explained how she'd fought her way right up front near door of the Armory to make sure she had a good chance at capturing her boyfriend's brother's face when he walked in the room after returning from Afghanistan.
