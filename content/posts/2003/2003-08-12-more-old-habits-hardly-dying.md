Simon Willison [Don't use document.all][1] reminds me that old habits should be reviewed every now and again, just to be sure they still make sense. Javascript's document.all is one that doesn't. As Simon says: "Don't use document.all. document.getElementById() is supported by every Javascript supporting browser released since 1998."
