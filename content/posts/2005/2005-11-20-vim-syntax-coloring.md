I'm used to having lovely syntax coloring in VIM using a terminal. Alas, when logging in to my Textdrive account it was not to be. It didn't bother me enough to do anything about until just a few minutes ago.

So. Put the following in .profile

    TERM=xterm-color; export TERM
    CLICOLOR=1; export CLICOLOR

And make sure the following is in your .vimrc file&#8230;

    syn on

Ooooh. Pretty.
