title: Headlines making you anxious? Delay reading them - Oliver Burkeman

[Oliver Burkeman, The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/apr/06/how-to-handle-headline-anxiety-take-time-reading-news-oliver-burkeman”):

> Of the 45 troubling things you saw on Twitter this morning, two or three may prove to be signs of the rise of fascism/the destruction of the environment/the collapse of Brexit Britain. Yet the rest won’t. Once, it was the media’s job to sift stories of lasting significance from the rest; today, any publication that sat on a story for a week, to see if it had legs, would get screamed at for suppressing the truth. The passage of time is the best filter for determining what matters. But being late is the one thing no social network, or modern news organisation, can afford.

Since canceling Facebook, pruning Twitter followers, disabling retweets, and limiting my news intake to The Economist and NYT (print edition), my headline anxiety has dropped to nearly zero.
