My Twitter stream was becoming so full of snark, entitlement, and whining that the two back-to-back local news updates above stood out and reminded me that there can also be good news and nice people.

I tire of listening to people making fun of everything, or bitching, or just being dicks all the time. When that happens I unfollow anyone who says anything remotely negative more than once in a 24-hour period. I end up following way fewer people, but I feel better. And I hope that feeling better helps me avoid being part of the problem.
