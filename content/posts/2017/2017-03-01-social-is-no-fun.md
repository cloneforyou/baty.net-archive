title: Social Is No Fun
---


I recently re-activated my Facebook account after a few months away. I
missed seeing updates from family members and a few close friends. I
also missed some of the topic-based “groups” I was part of.

I took a month or so off Twitter also, but now am back.

I’m finding that being on social media isn’t much fun anymore. I’ll stay
for now, but the thrill is long gone.
