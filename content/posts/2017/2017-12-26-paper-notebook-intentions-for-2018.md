The final week of December is a good time for planning. I spend the week organizing things, tidying up my desk and files, and laying out plans for the year.

One thing I evaluate each year is how I intend to use my paper notebooks. This doesn&#8217;t mean I don&#8217;t allow myself to change things up, but I at least go through the exercise of _thinking through my intentions_.

2018 looks much the same as 2017. Here&#8217;s the plan.

**Leuchtturm1917** (Medium, Dotted)

The [Leuchtturm1917][1] is my [Bullet Journal][2]. I&#8217;ve been using a Bullet Journal for several years and have found no better system for managing my personal life. Tasks, lists, quotes, and ideas all go in mine. I don&#8217;t use a BuJo for work projects, but for personal stuff it&#8217;s a terrific system. I use a [Quiver][3] to hold whatever pens I&#8217;m favoring at the moment.

**Epica Classic Leather Journal**

The Bullet Journal is messy and random, so I use a fancy [Epica leather journal][4] for my personal journal (aka Diary). I try to write at least a page or two every day, but typically only use it once or twice a week. I am hoping to get closer my goal of writing in it daily this year. A personal journal is priceless and will be kept forever so I forgive myself the luxury. The paper in these books isn&#8217;t my favorite for fountain pens so I typically use a pencil.

**Hobonichi Techo**

Paper calendars remain my favorite way to plan my life, and the [Hobonichi Techo][5] is full of them. Monthly, yearly, weekly, daily, you name it. The Techo uses Tomoe River paper, which is tissue thin yet handles anything thrown at it. As with my journal, I try to add something to the Techo every day. Usually this is a small drawing or a note about the weather or a fun quote or just splash of watercolor. It also contains vertical calendar pages that work well for habit tracking, so I don&#8217;t need to create them by hand in my Bullet Journal. I&#8217;ve been using these cute little notebooks since 2013. They&#8217;re fun and useful and I intend to use mine often in 2018.

**Field Notes** (with Bellroy cover)

I don&#8217;t carry my larger notebooks everywhere, so I always keep a [Field Notes][6] notebook in my back pocket. I find that capturing a quick note in a paper notebook to be much faster than using my phone. It takes a while for me to go through one, and the covers tend to degrade and come off over time. To prevent this I keep mine in a [Bellroy Notebook Cover][7]. The Bellroy feels and works great. I review my notes every few days and copy anything important to somewhere more permanent.

**OtherÂ ****miscellaneous notebooks**

I use a few other notebooks for various tasks.

  * [Boorum and Pease 9300R Record Book][8] for recording the books, movies, and shows that I watch
  * [Boorum & Pease 21300R Record Book][9] for taking notes in meetings
  * [Apica Premium C.D. Notebook][10] for client-specific projects

There are times I want to consolidate everything into just one or two notebooks but this feels like a pretty good setup for next year.
