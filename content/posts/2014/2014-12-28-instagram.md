I don’t like Instagram. Never have. Why?

**Too mobile-centric**.

I spend way more time with photos at a computer. Why shouldn’t I be able to post something from there? The instagram web app/site is basically useless.

**Tiny photos**.

Looking at photos on a tiny phone screen is the worst. And the app won’t let me zoom. I hate that.

**Square format**.

I shoot a lot of 6&#215;6 film and I love the square format. I just don’t want to be forced to use it for every single image unless I want to cheat.

**No access from other apps.**

It seems the only way to post an image to Instagram is from the Instagram app or via way too many workarounds. Take a look at what [Flickr offers][1]. Everything can easily post to Flickr.

**Filters**.

Gross.

But I’m willing to reconsider using Instagram. For some reason everyone else uses it even though Flickr is now clearly better. And I suppose I’m not really _sharing_ photos if no one is around to see them.

So I’ll use both. I’ll continue posting to Flickr from my desktop just like I have since 2004, then I’ll save the image from Flickr to my camera roll and post it to Instagram.

I’m [thejackbaty][2] on Instagram. I better see some likes!
