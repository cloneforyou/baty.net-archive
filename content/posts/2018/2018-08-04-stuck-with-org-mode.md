I've been feeling rather point-and-clicky lately, so I decided to move all
my tasks to [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) and use it for the month
of August. 

I spent a few hours moving everything out of Org-mode into Things, and it was a
terrible idea. Things is great, and the iOS version is one of my favorites on
the platform, but I missed Org-mode almost immediately.

It always starts out fine. I "ooh" and "aah" quite a lot, saying, "Now THIS
is how a task manager should look! Org-mode is sooo dry and complicated." And to
be fair, Org-mode _is_ dry and complicated. Plain text is boring. Not being able
to just drag things around and having to remember 7,500 keybindings instead is
complicated and wearisome.

No matter which task manager I use, I end up
ignoring what's in it anyway. It's counterintuitive, but switching task managers is a
very productive process for me, so this hasn't been a total wash.

There's just no way I could use anything but Org-mode now. It's simply too
good at everything I want a task manager to be good at. The only thing I
miss is a decent iOS option for the iPad. On the other hand, I rarely manage tasks
on the iPad anyway, so I'll be sticking with Org-mode. Probably forever[^maybe].

[^maybe]: With my usual quarterly attempts to leave it for something else.
