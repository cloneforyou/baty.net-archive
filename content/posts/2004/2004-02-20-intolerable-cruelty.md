As a huge fan of the Coen brothers, I expect a lot from each new movie. Intolerable Cruelty wasn't the best Coen film, but a mediocre Coen movie beats the crap out of most "good" movies.

A few reasons to enjoy the movie&#8230;

  1. Catherine Zeta-Jones


  2. George Clooney's Teeth


  3. Asthma Inhaler Scene


  4. Catherine Zeta-Jones

Quick, fairly sharp dialog between beautiful people is always fun. Toss in a few (restrained) bits of the typical oddball Coen sensibilities and you've got something pretty, fun, offbeat and well worth watching.
