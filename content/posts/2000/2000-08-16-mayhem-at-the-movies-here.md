[Mayhem at the movies][1]

Here we go again! "What makes it possible is a platform called DivX;<del>), which enables a 90-minute DVD movie to be compressed to about a tenth or less of its original size with little discernible loss of quality. The file can then be distributed with relative ease over the Internet, usually played back using Microsoft's Windows Media Player (WMP).
