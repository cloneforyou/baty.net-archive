Don's still the man when it comes to usable things. New Scientist [interviewed him][1].

"The cellphone is a very interesting development &#8211; it's really an emotion machine. The very success of SMS, despite the difficulty of using it, is that it lets people sort of touch each other and keep in touch throughout the day. It's not about sending factual information, it's about keeping the social structure going."
