This is also not my dog &#8211; technically. Mary left for Ireland the day after
  

  
Zara was brought home from the breeder. What could I do but volunteer to
  

  
take care of her. She's not housebroken, she chews everything, and she
  

  
kept me up all night for a week (Zara, not Mary.) I also couldn't help
  

  
falling in love with the little monster.
