I shot some Super8 (Tri-X) and finally got the processed reel back. The above is from a Retro-8 scan and quick edit. It was a bit underexposed so the corrections amplify the grain, but I still like how it looks.

I told myself I was only going to shoot a couple of reels just to say I did, but after watching it a few times I'm starting to think about trying more of it. The look of 8mm film can be faked, but cannot be replicated.
