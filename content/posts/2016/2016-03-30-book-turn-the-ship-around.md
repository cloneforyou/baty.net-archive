I loved this book. Someone described it accurately as "The Hunt For Red October" meets "Seven Habits of Highly Effective People." A few of my highlighted quotes:

> A little rudder far from the rocks is a lot better than a lot of rudder close to the rocks
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> Provide people with the objective and let them figure out the method
> 
> &nbsp;
> 
> What do we do on a day-to-day basis? We learn.
