I've always advocated the use of liquid design, but had trouble finding good examples. Liquid design, from a user's perspective, can be a great thing. I love being able to resize my browser window and have a site's contents nicely reflow to fit. In many cases, maximizing the browser window and cranking up the text size makes content-heavy sites more convenient to read. It's a design challenge, to be sure, especially with screen resolutions really getting up there. Besides, it's much easier to just lock everything in to some specific width. Keeps those pesky users from messing up the design. Anyway, [Simon Willison][1] points out a good example in the [Rocky Mountain Harley-Davidson site][2].
