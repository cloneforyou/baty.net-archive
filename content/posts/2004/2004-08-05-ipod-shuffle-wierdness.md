I bought myself a new iPod for my birthday (since no one else was thinking clearly enough to buy me one, apparently).

I usually just hit "Shuffle songs" and I instantly have the worlds best commercial-free radio station. I've noticed recently that something is strange about the songs that it picks to play. For example, the last four songs were all disturbingly related to death.

  * Living Dead Girl (Rob Zombie)


  * Coattails of a Dead Man (Primus)


  * A Leonard Cohen song which starts: "See you from the other side" 


  * Take it With Me (Tom Waits)
</ul> 

Old long since gone
  

  
Now way back when
  

  
We lived in Coney Island
  

  
Ain't no good thing
  

  
Ever dies
  

  
I'm gonna take it with me
  

  
When I go
  

  
(Tom Waits)

Creepy.

If you're susceptible to that sort of nonsense. (he says with just a little too much conviction)
