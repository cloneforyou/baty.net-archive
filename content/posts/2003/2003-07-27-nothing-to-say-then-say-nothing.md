For those bloggers who go a day or two with nothing interesting to write about, for god's sake don't waste everyone's time _apologizing_ for it. Just sit there quietly until you do have something to say. Save us the trouble of seeing your blog title finally light up in bold or whatever in our aggregators and eagerly clicking the link, only to find there's still nothing to read.
