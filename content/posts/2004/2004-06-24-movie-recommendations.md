[The Station Agent][1]

My favorite from last year, now on DVD.

[Bad Santa][2]

Billy Bob starts out nasty and never gets much nicer. Funny throughout. Also, John Ritter was great in his final role.

[The Office][3]

Not technically a movie. Why didn't anyone tell me about this? I just watched the complete season (DVD) and it's Hilarious. Watch it.
