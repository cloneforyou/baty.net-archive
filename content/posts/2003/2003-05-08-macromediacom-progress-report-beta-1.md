I'm rather impressed with the way Macromedia is handling the
  

  
less-that-stellar response to their new web site. In sort of a
  

  
"oh-that-was-just-a-beta" move, they've released [beta 2][1], which is a vast
  

  
improvement over the original release. They're documenting what
  

  
they've learned. The summary is [here][2].

I'm a fan of ColdFusion and Flash, but I'm typically very skeptical of
  

  
Macromedia. My skepticism could diminish if they can finally admit
  

  
that Flash may not save the world, but can play an important role in
  

  
it.
