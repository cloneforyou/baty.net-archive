Mr. Merlin over at 43Folders drops a lovely piece entitled [Five Mistakes Band & Label Sites Make][1]. Most of the mistakes apply to _any_ type of site. A few short quotes below, but read the whole thing anyway&#8230;

**1. Too much Flash**

"Okay, I get it. You&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re creative. Awesome. But you&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re totally wasting my morning&#8230;. Use Flash like you would cilantro&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;"sparingly and for a single high-impact effect. Nobody wants to eat a whole bowl of cilantro, and nobody wants an animated death march when they have a &#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#339;passionate task&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;? to complete."

**2. Crappy or non existent mp3 metadata**

"Remember: people often download dozens or hundreds of songs at once, so it&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;s really unlikely they&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ll remember where Track_07.mp3 came from. "

**3. Too artsy, too fartsy**

"People are visiting your site because they want to learn more about bands and music&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;"not to have a guided tour of your designer/brother-in-law&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;s Photoshop brush collection."

**4. No search**

"If your site contains more than a handful of pages, provide a clearly labeled search box (or link to a search) on every page, and test it."

**5. One-way communication (served one way)**

"Read your email, and answer it."
