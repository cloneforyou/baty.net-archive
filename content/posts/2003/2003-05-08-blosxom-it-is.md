So, in keeping with my policy of messing with things that are working fine,
  

  
we're now running the site using [Blosxom][1].
  

  
Why? Well because its design philosophy matches the tool and its purpose. A simple, filesystem-based blogging
  

  
tool in one small perl script easily portable to any operating system. I love [Movable Type][2],
  

  
but it was overkill in many cases, and installing it was way too much work. And I typically **like** that sort of thing.
  


Here's a snippet from Rael's site&#8230;

That's what I'm talkin bout.</p>
