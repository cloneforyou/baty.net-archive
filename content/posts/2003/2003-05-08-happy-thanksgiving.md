Happy Thanksgiving all!

Without sounding too corny, I’d like to thank…

  * Jessica, my daughter, and greatest challenge.
  * My work and business partners. I couldn’t ask for better.
  * Parents who do much more for me than I deserve.
  * A few close, trusted friends.
  * The resolve of a great country.

Oh, and can I mention a few little things…

  * Single-malt scotch. A short glass at night – yum.
  * Candles. Vanilla, burned evenings while I work.
  * Movies. Discovering some obscure little film is the best.
  * CD Burners, Limewire, and MP3s
  * amazon.com. For helping me live beyond my means.
  * eBay. See amazon.com
  * FreeBSD. Opened up a whole new set of possibilities.
  * Funny people. I’m lucky to be near a few.
  * Starr Puffs. One after another after another.
