title: In My (Peak Design 5L Sling) Bag
---

Here's a snap of today's all-analog combo in the [Peak Design Everyday Sling 5L](https://www.peakdesign.com/products/everyday-sling-5/).

-   Fuji Instax Square camera
-   Leica M6 w/50mm Summicron
-   Film for both

I love this bag. I wish that the clever strap adjustment mechanism worked more easily, but otherwise, for carrying a small camera and accessories it's nearly perfect.
