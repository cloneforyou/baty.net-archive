Window resizing sucks all the way &#8216;round. First, I have to hit one little tiny corner way down there in order to resize a window. Windows does this better. Second, it takes _forever_ for windows to redraw after resizing. Seek, click, drag,&#8230; wait for it&#8230;, window resizes. Some apps are worse than others, but sheesh.

The iMac G5 may not be the fastest Mac available, but are you telling me I need 2 processors in order to move a simple little window around the screen?

Other than that, and not being able to delete files using just the &#8216;delete' key, it's all good.
