Ok fine, Josh, I&#8217;m not going to argue with you. Lots of other people will do that. And many others will argue with _them_ . And so on.

But also: Pot, meet Kettle.

I mean, have you _looked at_ [The Outline&#8217;s website][2]? I love what they&#8217;re trying to do there, but wow what an affront to the senses.

I just love that the pull quote above is bordered by those tacky animated wiggly lines. Good times.
