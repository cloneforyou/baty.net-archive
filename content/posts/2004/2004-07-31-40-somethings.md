Last week I turned 40. On that particular day, every time I returned to my desk I would find another collection of 40 _things_ on my desk. Things like&#8230;
  


</p> 

  * 40 cans of Diet Coke


  * 40 army guys


  * 40 cents


  * 40 suckers (Dum Dums, specifically)


  * 40 peanuts


  * 40oz Malt Liquor
</ul> 

I may have missed some, but you get the idea. Also, my cake was frosted in a lovely Viagra blue. Late in the day I finally noticed that everyone in the office had dressed in black; which I can only assume was meant to signify the passing of my youth.

Time for my nap now.
