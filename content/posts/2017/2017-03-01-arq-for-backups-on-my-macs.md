title: Arq for Backups On My Macs

![Arq](/img/2017/arq_icon.png)

I’m diligent when it comes to backing up my computers. I make sure to
always have local and offsite copies of everything. Years ago I began
using Stefan Reitshamer’s [Arq](https://www.arqbackup.com/) utility for
making offline copies (to Amazon S3) and it was great. That is, until
ongoing storage costs became prohibitive. S3 was relatively cheap at the
time, but I was still paying hundreds of dollars per year for storage.
When Backblaze and Crashplan showed up at \$5/month for “unlimited”
backups, I switched (to Crashplan).

I never got on well with Crashplan. I never felt that I could “see” what
was going on with my backups. The interface feels janky and the app
would sometimes refuse to run after OS upgrades. But, it did the job and
was cheap.

While reviewing my backups after the new year, I took another look at
Arq and was reminded what a nice app it is. Arq just feels better. It
can back up from anything to just about anywhere and does so quickly and
securely. And the costs? One of the targets available is Amazon Cloud
Drive, which offers “unlimited” storage for \$60/year.

So I’m back to using Arq for my backups and couldn’t be happier.
