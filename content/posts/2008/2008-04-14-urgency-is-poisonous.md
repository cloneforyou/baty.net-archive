I find myself agreeing (mostly) with Jason Fried's post, [Urgency is poisonous][1]

> "One thing I’ve come to realize is that urgency is overrated. In fact, I’ve come to believe urgency is poisonous. Urgency may get things done a few days sooner, but what does it cost in morale? Few things burn morale like urgency. Urgency is acidic."

(Via [Signal vs. Noise][2].)
