I have taken to carrying three notebooks. Here's how (or better, when) I use them. 

**Before it happens**

I use a [Hobonichi Techo Planner](http://www.1101.com/store/techo/en/) for scheduling and planning. It's
loaded with calendars and dated pages.

The Hobonichi is a wonderful, easy-to-carry planner that uses Tomoe River paper;
my favorite. I record all event-based information in one. On each day's page I
write a list of things relevant to that day. I sometimes include a small sketch
representing the day.

**While it's happening**

I use a [Field Notes](https://fieldnotesbrand.com) notebook to jot things down while I'm away from a desk.

The Field Notes notebook fits in my pocket, so I always have it with me. With
it, I can quickly capture things any time.

**After it happens**

I use a [Leuchtturm1917](https://www.leuchtturm1917.us) notebook to record notes
and keep lists. It's a modified [Bullet Journal](http://bulletjournal.com).

The Leuchtturm is great for longer-form notes and lists. It's my bullet journal
and where I collect things captured in the Field Notes notebook once I'm back at
my desk.


My notebook configuration changes regularly, but I like where things are now.
