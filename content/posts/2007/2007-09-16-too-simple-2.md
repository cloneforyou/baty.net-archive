There's this new app, [Jottit][1], which let's you create a simple web page with notes. We've got at least, oh, 43 of these already so how's this one different? Well, it's just so dang simple! Check it out&#8230;

In fact, it seems to be little more than an exercise in UI and feature reduction. It's like 37Signals dialed their mantra all the way up. Jottit is admittedly a nice app, but we don't need any more online note-taking apps. Do we? 

When does the Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work become, well, too simple?
