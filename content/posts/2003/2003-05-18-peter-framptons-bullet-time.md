I haven't seen the new Matrix movie yet, but on my way in to the
  

  
office this morning I heard "Do You Feel Like We Do?" from "Frampton
  

  
Comes Alive."

So what? Well, it occurred to me that both the Frampton song and the
  

  
first Matrix movie contained what are probably now known as "bullet
  

  
time moments." You know, that moment when you say to yourself "Holy
  

  
crap! that's the coolest thing EVER!" In the original Matrix it was
  

  
the bullet time scenes. In the Frampton song, it was the talk box. I
  

  
remember buying the Frampton Comes Alive album when it came out &#8211; 25
  

  
years ago now. And I remember the shivers and awe that I experienced
  

  
when the guy's guitar started to SING! It was cool then, and after
  

  
hearing it again this morning, it's still cool.

I think that perhaps much of what keeps me exploring is the desire to
  

  
experience more moments like that.
