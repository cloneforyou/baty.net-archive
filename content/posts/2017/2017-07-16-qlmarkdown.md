I thought it odd that Quicklook doesn't work on Markdown files. I found the
quicklook plugin, [QLMarkdown](https://github.com/toland/qlmarkdown/), which not
only makes Quicklook work with Markdown (.md) files, but it actually renders the
markdown.

Installed using Homebrew as directed and it just worked.

```
$ brew update
$ brew cask install qlmarkdown
```
