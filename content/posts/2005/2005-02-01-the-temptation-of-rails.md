Oh boy. If I even _mention_ a new development platform around [the office][1], people start to break out in hives. Let's just say the phrase "Now what?!" has been bandied about on more than one occasion.

But this time it's different&#8230; honest!

If ever a bandwagon felt like a good one to jump on, [Ruby on Rails][2] is it. This looks to be, based on a weekend or so of fiddling, a fantastic framework. Just reading the [API][3] gave me any number of No Freakin' Way! moments. In all fairness, I have to admit that I have very little experience with some of the also fabulous (I'm sure) Java frameworks, but they're&#8230; well&#8230; Java. And .NET? That's not even Java, it's&#8230; you know who.

Can't wait to see how this pans out.
