title: Don’t start the revolution without me

You've probably noticed that every day, the media makes us painfully aware of the world's sorry state. We've had a couple of wars, economic "downturns", kids with bombs strapped to them and whatnot. Folks hanging the charred bodies of murdered civilians from bridges was the last straw&#8212;I've decided to stop watching the news for a while. Put my head in the sand, so to speak.

In the meantime, whenever the world, (i.e. America), has been in a funk for any length of time, we tend to start some sort of happy-happy musical/cultural revolution. I say it's about damn time. Of course I hope it's not disco again this time, but at this point I'll take just about anything.
