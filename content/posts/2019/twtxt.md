I was reminded today[^0xroy] of [twtxt](https://twtxt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), "a decentralised, minimalist microblogging service for hackers."

It would be neat if more people used it regularly. My feed is at http://tilde.club/~jbaty/twtxt.txt if you're looking for something to follow. It's super simple and kind of fun.

[^0xroy]: It was [0xroy's post](https://www.0xroy.me/2019/09/23/i-created-a.html) that made me think of it.
