[Free Software Foundation Giving Guide 2014][1]

> Are you giving your loved ones holiday gifts they can use freely, or gifts which put someone else in control?

Neither, I’m giving them gifts they _want_. Seriously, I’m all for the FSF and love the idea of being in complete control of my media, software, and devices. But come on, no one I know would choose any of the Free options listed unless trying to prove a point. I suppose proving a point is what the list is for in the first place. Still, I’m not ready to give up on the _good_ stuff until the Free stuff is _better_. Or at least remotely as good.
