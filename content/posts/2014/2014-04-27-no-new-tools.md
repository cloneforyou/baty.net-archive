[Frank Chimero][1]:

> I made an agreement with myself in January: no new apps on my phone or computer. Don&#x2019;t do new stuff. Just do your work.

I started reading Frank Chimero&#x2019;s post with delight, because I have been thinking along the same lines. I thought what he was about to say was that he should learn to use the tools he has and stop trying new things all the time. I thought he was going to offer some advice about how to do that, since I suffer from the same problem. 

But then this&#8230;

> So, now I come to the part where I make my plea: no new tools, please. If you are interested in improving how people work, you should devise methods for work, manners of behavior, and methods of decision making.

This sounds like he&#x2019;s saying that since he has trouble sticking with a tool to get work done, other people shouldn&#x2019;t build anything new that might be a distraction. I suppose that might not be what he means, but it sure reads that way.

He&#x2019;s right, we probably don&#x2019;t need yet another todo app. I for one don&#x2019;t, and my &#x201c;system&#x201d; sometimes just locks up due to the sheer number of great apps available for every task. On the other hand, I wouldn&#x2019;t suggest that developers stop trying to create new things just because I can&#x2019;t control my impulses. Who&#x2019;s to say when we&#x2019;re done innovating?

> Document your ideology and apply it with existing tools, so nearly anyone can follow along.

Amen. I would love to see more of that.
