I&#8217;ve only had it [out again for a few weeks][1], but I&#8217;ve already put my beloved iPhone SE back in the drawer. As much as I love its size, shape, and Touch ID, the little SE doesn&#8217;t fit as well into my life as well as the X. Its battery only gives me about a half-day of use. It doesn&#8217;t fit in my car holder. It&#8217;s a lot slower, and the camera is much worse. I could probably take care of most of these if I tried hard enough, but I&#8217;d just be swimming upstream.

Apple isn&#8217;t going to make another small phone like the SE. I&#8217;m better off moving on. It&#8217;s disappointing, but fine. It&#8217;s just a phone.
