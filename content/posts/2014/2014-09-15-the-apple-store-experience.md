  At some point over the past couple of years I began to dread going to the Apple Store. That's a shame, since for a long time I couldn't wait to go there. I'd go just to browse around (and usually end up buying something). It was smooth, clean, relatively quiet, and a completely pleasent experience.

  Now, it's sort of a clusterfuck. They pass me from one associate to another. I stand in one line waiting to stand in another. Today someone basically just pointed me at a computer to "easily take care of that online" then left me to wait for about 20 minutes. I could've done that from my comfy chair at home. I probably should have.
