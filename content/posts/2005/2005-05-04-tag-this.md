I have been a fan of "tagging" content since first using sites like [Flickr][1] and [del.icio.us][2]. CNN has [picked up on it also][3]. This is a sign that soon we'll be tagging everything, whether it makes sense or not. It'll mostly be a good thing, at least until the spammers figure it out.

One quote I'm not sure about from the article, though&#8230;

There's just something wrong with that.
