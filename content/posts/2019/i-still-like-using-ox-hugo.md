title: I still like using ox-hugo
---

I'm still using [ox-hugo](https://ox-hugo.scripter.co) for publishing with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). I like writing in org-mode. I also like that my entire site can be in a single text file. It's clever enough to be helpful, but not so clever that it feels like magic.

Here's a current screenshot.
