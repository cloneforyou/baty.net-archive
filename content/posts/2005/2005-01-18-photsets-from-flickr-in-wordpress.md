While using Textpattern for this site I started work on a plugin for displaying Flickr photos. I never got past the proof of concept phase, and moved to WordPress before having a chance to finish it. Thankfully, I don't have to recreate it here, since [this fine plugin][1] seems to work lovely.

I've created a WordPress "static" page template and tossed a call to the plugin at my new [/flickr/][2] page

That will do just fine for now.
