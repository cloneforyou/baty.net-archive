[Lucy Inglis][1]:

> But what needs to stop right now is ascribing simplistic, headline-grabbing motives to the actions of fragmented and troubled individuals such as Elliot Rodger just because they suit an agenda, no matter how worthy that agenda might be. The evidence left by the killer himself indicates that no one thing or incident led to Saturdayâ€™s events but an awful maelstrom of mental instability, social and sexual conditioning, race, loneliness, basic human cravings and rejection.

An uncommonly balanced interpretation. Worth a read.
