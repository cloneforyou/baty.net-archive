[A Primer on Fountain Pens | The Art of Manliness][1]:

> Taking a break from click-clacking away at one’s keyboard to write something out by hand — <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2008/10/23/the-art-of-thank-you-note-writing/" target="_blank">a thank you note</a>, <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/01/01/jumpstart-your-journaling-a-31-day-challenge/" target="_blank">a journal entry</a>, <a href="http://www.artofmanliness.com/2014/03/26/want-to-become-a-better-writer-copy-the-work-of-others/" target="_blank">a page of copywork</a> — is a uniquely pleasurable activity.
