My house was being taken over by a bridal shower, so my sister Crystal was nice enough to invite me and the dogs over to celebrate her birthday.&nbsp;

Crystal has 5 pugs so that makes for a total of 8 dogs between us.&nbsp; It was a busy afternoon. I did have time to put a couple rolls through the trusty Leica M3. (Above all using M3 and 9cm Collapsible Elmar with Tri-X and processed in XTOL.)
