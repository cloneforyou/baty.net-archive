I just want to go on record saying (er, writing) that audioblogging is stupid. Reading most blogs can be painful enough without actually having to _hear_ them. Not only that, but there are no links in an audioblog entry. Oh, and I can't skim them either. I'll stick with tiny, impossible to read medium-grey on light grey text, thanks.
