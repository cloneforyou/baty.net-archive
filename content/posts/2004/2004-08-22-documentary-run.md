I've been watching an odd assortment of documentary or near-documentary films lately. For those interested, here's a summary.

**[Touching the Void][1]** *****
  

  
Story of two mountain climbers' nightmare while climbing the Siula Grande mountain in the Peruvian Andes. One of them breaks his leg and from then on it's pinned-to-your-seat dramatization coupled with interviews with the climbers.</p> 

</strong>[Step into Liquid][2] **</b>**
  

  
Breathtaking photography of surfers and surfing around the world.

**[Capturing the Friedmans][3]** *****
  

  
Arnold Friedman, normal guy with a normal family, is accused of being a child pornographer. The movie documents he and his family's decline and disintegration in the following months and years.</p> 

</strong>[The Weather Underground][4] **</b>
  

  
Story of the Weatherman, a radical group of anti-war protesters formed during the 60s.</p> 

</strong>[My Voyage to Italy][5] ****</strong>
  

  
Martin Scorcese spends a few hours talking about his favorite films of Italian cinema. Listening to him causes a contagious affect that makes me want to watch everything he's talking about.</p> 

**[War Photographer][6]** </b>**
  

  
Portrait of world-renowned photojournalist James Nachtwey.
