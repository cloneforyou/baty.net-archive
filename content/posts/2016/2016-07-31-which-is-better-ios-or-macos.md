title: Which is better, iOS or macOS?

It's a silly question, but I know the answer.

The answer is that the one I _want_ to be better is better.

See [Dr. Drang][1] and [Ben Brooks][2] and [Watts Martin][3] for recent examples of this discussion. There are many more.

For the record I find iOS to be fun but macOS to be more usefulÂ for nearly everything. I guess I'll always need a [truck][4]. Maybe I'm just an old dog.

I did enjoy Brooks explaining away the difficulties with iOS ("Ease has nothing to do with it"), and then later saying, "Give it time", bringing it nicely back to the Desktop Linux argument.

I can't predict whether people like [Federico Viticci][5] are pioneers or outliers. Time will tell.
