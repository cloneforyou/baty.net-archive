On my way from some database work to some PHP work today, I needed to
  

  
clean up some files of one of our web servers. Just a simple thing,
  

  
zip up and delete a web site directory that we'd recently moved to
  

  
newer hardware. That's what I did, except it was the wrong directory.
  

  
I had just deleted a live, well-trafficked web site. Poof! Gone!

It took only about 20 minutes to restore it from tape, but somehow a
  

  
bunch of important sales information log files were missing.

I've been feeling sick all afternoon. It proves that there's no such
  

  
thing as a trivial task. Pay attention!
