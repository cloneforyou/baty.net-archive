My new MacBook Pro arrived yesterday. This will replace my aging,
2-year old version. It's a thing of beauty. Whenever I get a new
machine, I'm tempted to just run the simple data migration to move
everything over, but never do. Instead, I start from scratch. This is
a complete pain in the ass, but very much worth the trouble. It just
feels so good!

Below is a list of things I installed this time. I'm listing only
software, not the geeky bits like Ruby On Rails, MacPorts etc. It took
me most of the day yesterday, but I think I've got things pretty much
how I like them.

  * [Launchbar][1] &#8211; Without a good launcher, using a Mac feels
    like working with one hand behind my back.
  * [Dropbox][2] &#8211; Sync made so easy it's ridiculous.
  * [Tinderbox][3] &#8211; "The tool for notes" (and nearly everything
    else.) This is where I live.
  * [1Password][4] &#8211; Passwords, forms, card numbers,
    etc. Beautifully done.
  * [Yojimbo][5] &#8211; An anything bucket. Simple enough that it
    actually gets used.
  * [BBEdit][6] &#8211; Text editing done very well. Yes, better than
    TextMate.
  * [OmniFocus][7] &#8211; Task management with enough oomph.
  * [AppZapper][8] &#8211; I change my mind a lot.
  * [Backblaze][9] &#8211; Online backup without thinking. Just in
    case.
  * [BusyCal][10] &#8211; Because iCal isn't good enough, and I don't
    like web based calendars.
  * [Daylite][11] &#8211; Gotta put all those contacts and
    opportunities somewhere.
  * [DEVONthink Pro][12] &#8211; Anything project related goes here,
    and I'm guaranteed to find it.
  * [Fluid][13] &#8211; For running web stuff as their own "apps".
  * [Interarchy][14] &#8211; SFTP client. I've been using this for
    years. No reason to change.
  * [MarsEdit][15] &#8211; Still the best way to consistently post to
    a number of sites.
  * [MindManager][16] &#8211; Mindmapping. Expensive, but still the
    best there is.
  * [NetNewsWire][17] &#8211; Because even the good web-based readers
    suck.
  * [OmmWriter][18]&#8211; Weird, new-agey writing app for
    distraction-free writing. Surprised by how much I like it.
  * [Photo Mechanic][19] &#8211; Not used as much now that I don't
    shoot digital, but it's great for pulling photos of cards when I
    do.
  * [QuickCursor][20] &#8211; Like the "Edit In&#8230;" plugins,
    without the hacks.
  * [Sequel Pro][21] &#8211; Best MySQL management GUI available.
  * [SizeUp][22] &#8211; Move and size windows with the keyboard.
  * [Skitch][23] &#8211; Almost perfect screen capture.
  * [Spirited Away][24] &#8211; Automatically hides inactive
    apps. Fits my minimalist tendencies nicely.
  * [SuperDuper][25] &#8211; Simple, bootable backups. Saved my ass a
    number of times.
  * [Ulysses][26] &#8211; Complete semantic writing environment.
  * [WriteRoom][27] &#8211; Distraction free writing.
  * [Lightroom][28] &#8211; Image management and editing. Does
    everything.
  * [Nik Plugins for Lightroom][29] &#8211; The Complete
    Collection. Awesome set of tools for Lightroom.
  * [SilverFast Ai Studio][30] &#8211; The best scanning results, with
    the worst UI of any software, anywhere.
  * [TextExpander][31] &#8211; Wonderful typing
    utility/accelerator. I'm lost without this.
  * [iStat Menus][32] &#8211; Very nice system monitors. I use the
    menu bar calendar instead of the built in version.
  * [Mail Act-On][33] &#8211; Keyboard email management for Mail.app.
  * [Chronosync][34] &#8211; Synchronizes all my external drives
    nicely, automatically, on a schedule.
  * [Acorn][35] &#8211; It really is "The image editor for humans." I
    despise Photoshop, and now I don't need it.
  * [ClickToFlash][36] &#8211; Great Safari plug-in which gets Flash
    under control.
