I've got one of Apple's fancy new flat keyboards and it's much better than the mushy old "crumb-catcher." It may be for sale soon, as I just discovered the [Mataias Tactile Pro][1]. It uses the same mechanical keyswitch as everyone's favorite, the [Apple Extended Keyboard][2]. I miss the solid, clicky-click of that old keyboard. I wonder.
