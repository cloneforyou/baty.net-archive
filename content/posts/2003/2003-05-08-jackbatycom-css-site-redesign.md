I've completely rewritten the
  

  
[CSS implementation][1] of this site. I'm
  

  
heading toward a structural markup and CSS only layout. For now, I'm
  

  
down to just a couple of tables for layout. I've removed every table
  

  
attribute into CSS rules and cleaned up a bit. At this point, I'm not
  

  
spending too much time on how it looks in older or buggy browsers. If
  

  
things look especially goofy in your particular browser, [email me][2] with details. I'd like
  

  
to solve as many problems as possible.
