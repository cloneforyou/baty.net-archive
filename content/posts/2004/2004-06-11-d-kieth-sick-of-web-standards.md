D. Kieth Robinson is [Sick of web standards][1]. I'll quote most of it here&#8230;

There are basically four reactions to posts on Web standards and frankly more advocacy doesn&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;t seem to be helping most of them.

# 1 You Already Get It

Well, this one is pretty obvious. You read a post on Web standards, you agree with it and can see all the advantages. I don&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;t really need to talk to you any more.

# 2 You&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ll Never Get It

No matter what I say, no matter how much real world or theoretical evidence I supply, you&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ll never see the value of Web standards. Good luck to you. I don&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;t need to talk to you any more.

# 3 You Expect Too Much

These people bother me the most. You&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re the person for whom nothing less that 100% valid code on every page I build is enough. In your mind I should just keep my mouth shut if I can&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;t &#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#339;walk the walk.&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;? Fine, I&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ll do that. I don&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;t want to talk to you any more. See you in the real world.

# 4 You&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re Interested and You Want To Know More

This is where I&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ve been trying to target most of my work. You&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;re the person who might be new to Web standards, but you&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#8482;ve just not been able to get your head around it. You work in the real world and want to see real world benefits. You want people to &#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#339;show&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;? rather than &#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;&#339;tell&#195;&#162;&#194;&#8364;&#194;?.

I think he's right.
