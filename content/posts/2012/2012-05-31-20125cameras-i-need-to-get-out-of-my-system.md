I want a Leica M3. Always have. For me the M3 represents the pinnacle of camera design, engineering, and construction. The newer, and very expensive MP is probably close, but I've never looked through the famed M3 .91 magnification finder, made specifically for 50mm (and longer) lenses. Need to try one.

The following cameras are also on my must try list, if only for a short time, so that I can stop thinking about using them.

  * Leica MP
  * Leica CL
  * Mamiya 7ii
  * Minolta TC-1
  * Contax 645
  * Contax T3
  * Konica Hexar AF

The M3 will be first, and if everything about it is as good as "they" say, I'll have it forever. The others are just to try. Right?
