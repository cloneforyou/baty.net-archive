[Our](<http://www.fusionary.com>) fabulous annual holiday "Coaster" was released last week. Play it yourself at [swoop-to-nuts.com](<http://www.swoop-to-nuts.com>). The arcade player in you will love it. Take a moment to get the hang of the controls and fly like a&#8230; well&#8230; like a squirrel!
