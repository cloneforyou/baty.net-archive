I've been using PHPetal for a few days now with very few problems. It's time to let folks break it and send me complaints/feedback and such. So I've made it available for download. This is a **very** early version, so any bugs, feature suggestions or comments are more than welcome.

Download: [phpetal-0_2.tgz][1]

Update: The latest version will always be found on the [downloads page][2]
