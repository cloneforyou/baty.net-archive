You may not know this, but I discovered Iron Maiden. Okay, maybe not, but I was the first of all my little headbanger friends to notice them back in oh, 1980 or so.

I've long since stopped listening to them, except for the occasional bout of nostalgia, so I missed the recent [outcry over the cover][1] of their new album. It reminded me of one of my great unfinished oil paintings from that era (shown here). Truth be told I can't remember why I didn't finish it, but I bet it had something to do with the fact that I didn't know how to paint Eddie's hair.
