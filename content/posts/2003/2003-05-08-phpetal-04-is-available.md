There's a new version of PHPetal. The major change is that it (optionally) pings weblogs.com after posting. I needed to add a couple new configuration settings in order to implement this. Anyone interested may [download it here][1]. Remember, this is still rather experimental, so please let me know ([][2]) if you run into any problems.
