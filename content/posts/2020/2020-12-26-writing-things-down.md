My grandfather once wondered how much paint he should buy in order to paint his
garage. My dad said, "Hang on.", went into his office and came out two minutes
later with a piece of paper and said, "We used just over two gallons of Benjamin
Moore white from Ace Hardware when we painted it last time in 1983. "

My dad doesn't have a fancy note-taking system. He sometimes jots things on
notebook paper or a receipt and puts them in a filing cabinet. Even so, he can
always find things. I think this is because he never ever thinks about his
process. He doesn't worry about creating a capital-W Workflow. He just keeps
what he thinks he might need later and tosses the rest.

A new year is approaching and it's time to review my own notetaking process
again. See, unlike my dad, I overthink the shit out of my Workflow.

For example, what happens with my journal? Should it remain in Org Journal or
perhaps move entirely into Roam? How about Day One? Or TiddlyWiki? What is a
journal anyway? I don't use journals consistently. For example, where should I
record that I changed the filter in the refrigerator? That's not really a
journal thing, but then what is it?

Perhaps a better question is, why record when I change the fridge filter at all?

I read a lot of articles about note-taking, journaling, Zettelkastan, and on and
on. Learning how people do things is interesting, but when I dig a little deeper
I notice that most of the articles are written by people who seem to only be
writing about note-taking or the broader topic of "productivity"[^guilty]. They
don't actually _do_ anything with it.

If I'm honest with myself, I fall into this group. I don't need fancy tools or
systems for taking notes. I _like_ them, but I don't _need_ them for what I'm
doing. I'm not doing any deep thinking or analysis or study. I mostly just want
to write things down so I can look them up later. A plain text file and `grep`
can handle that just fine.

The thing I need to determine is whether the fun I have playing with note-taking systems
and tools is worth the stress and complexity it causes. I'm beginning to think
not. I'm beginning to think I should stop writing so many things down and just
stick to the things I may actually need later. And I should do this in simple
tools which do little more than let me look up the specific thing I want to know.

Do I need a list of contextual backlinks in Roam showing me details around every
time I changed the fridge filter? Probably not. Is it cool to have that?
Definitely. So, I guess my goal over the coming weeks is to determine whether I
should prioritize cool tools or my sanity when it comes to taking notes.

[^guilty]: I suppose this post may qualify as an example of that.
