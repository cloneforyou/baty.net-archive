[When Should You Keep Your Ideas to Yourself?][1] &#8211; Marshall Goldsmith

**Before speaking to your direct reports:**

  * Look into the other person’s eyes. Ask yourself, ‘Will my ‘added value’ make this person more – or less – committed to doing a great job?’
  * If the answer is ‘less committed’, then ask yourself, ‘Does the value added by my contribution exceed the loss in commitment by this person?’
  * If the answer is ‘no’ – don’t comment.
