I've considered myself a blogger since I first set up jackbaty.com in 1999. At first, I did what everyone else did; linked to things I thought were interesting, occasionally throwing in a sentence or two about them as well. That was it. That was blogging. Then, for a while, I tried writing longer, original-content posts, but that didn't last. Seems original thought isn't my bag. What I've realized is that I'm still doing pretty much the same thing today as I was 8 years ago &#8211; and it's boring.

So now what? 

I don't know. What I do know is that posting relevant, insightful and original content doesn't seem to be happening here at all, so I may just stop trying &#8211; for now. I still enjoy linking to things I find interesting, but [Tumbler][1] works just fine for that. 

I'm still figuring out what this site is about. I suspect it's simply about \*me\*, but doesn't [Facebook][2] do a better job of that already?

See you back here when Facebook stops being Facebook and Twitter stops being Twitter &#8211; 'cause jackbaty.com will _always_ be jackbaty.com &#8211; a network of one.
