In 1959, after watching her daughter, Barbara playing with paper dolls, Ruth Handler invented the Barbie doll. 351,000 were sold the first year and more than one billion more have been sold since. Oh, and the name of Ruth's son? Yep, it was Ken. In 1961, Barbie met Ken and they've been together ever since.

Until now that is. Apparently [they've split up][1]. What hope do any of us have after this?
