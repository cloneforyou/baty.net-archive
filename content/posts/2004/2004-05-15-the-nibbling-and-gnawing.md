the nibbling and gnawing
  
uncertainty of a new faith
  
fear of being consumed
  
eaten alive by imaginary things
  
and some not quite

trust deserved, offered even
  
yet tethered by tiny ropes
  
disappearing into fog and dust
  
anchored by them and then
  
and longing to be cast off
  
severed by that firm reliance
  
spoken of, but not quite realized
