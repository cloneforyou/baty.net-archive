Dropbox has always been one of those services that did exactly what it was
supposed to, and did so without fuss or bother.

Lately, not so much. More often than not when my CPU is pegged it's because of
Dropbox.
The
[hacky way](http://applehelpwriter.com/2016/08/29/discovering-how-dropbox-hacks-your-mac/) Dropbox
enables permissions for itself is discomforting.

And now [this thing](http://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/10/04/dropboxs-finder-toolbar/)
with an unwanted Finder toolbar. It showed up yesterday for me and it
immediately irritated me and I couldn't disable it. Gross.

I'd quit Dropbox and use [Resilio](https://www.resilio.com) (formerly
Bittorrent) Sync for everything but so many other services integrate nicely with
Dropbox that I'm not quite ready for that yet.

Getting there, though.
