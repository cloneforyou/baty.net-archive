I saw a trailer some time ago for a movie about a bunch of kids being taught by Jack Black and, although a closet Jack Black fan, I immediately dismissed it. "That **has** to suck!" I think I said.

The movie was [School of Rock][1] and I was wrong. If ever a film was made for an actor, this was it. Black is great, the (unknown) kids are great. Joan Cusack is perfect. It's nice without being overly-sentimental. The kids are cute without being too cute. And there's a lot of good old rock &#8216;n roll. See it.
