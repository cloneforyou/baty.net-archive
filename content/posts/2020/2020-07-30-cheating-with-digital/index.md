Photographs should not be significantly altered in post. It&#8217;s cheating. This is how I feel. I suppose if you consider yourself a &#8220;digital illustrator&#8221; rather than photographer, then sure, but otherwise, it&#8217;s cheating.

And oh my how easy it is to cheat these days. Here&#8217;s an example. I took the following photo yesterday during a walk at the beach with my daughter.

Ok, I lied, the photo I actually took was this oneâ€¦

Pretty similar, right? Except that my photo had no birds in it, and the sky was dull and boring, as far as skies go.

It took me about 4 clicks in the latest version of [Luminar][1] to replace the sky with something slightly more dramatic and to add a few birds, just for the hell of it. The result is the &#8220;same&#8221; photo but just jazzed up a little, right?

No, it&#8217;s not. It&#8217;s cheating and it&#8217;s not what happened. My goal when taking photographs is to record things I&#8217;m interested in or to show how I see things. I realize not everyone feels this way, but cheating like I did here ruins the photo for me. Yes, if I were scrolling through Instagram I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;d prefer the altered version, but it&#8217;s not how I want to do things.

It&#8217;s so tempting, though! If it only takes a few clicks to go from decent to Wow!, why wouldn&#8217;t I? I&#8217;d like to make the slippery slope argument here. I mean, just look at how awesome this sunset photo is!

But, you know, some hard-working photographer somewhere is spending days getting to beautiful places and waiting long hours for just the right moment. Then, finally, the light and sky and _everything_ comes together for the shot. By cheaply and easily altering my images, I diminish the work done by those who are out doing it for real. It feels wrong. It feels like cheating and I want no part of it.
