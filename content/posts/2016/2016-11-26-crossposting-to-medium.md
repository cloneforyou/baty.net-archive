title: Cross-posting to Medium
---

This post is mostly to test whether or not my new [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/)
recipe is working.

I like Medium, but I don't want to [live there](https://medium.com/@jackbaty). The best compromise might be to
cross-post things from baty.net. I hesitate to automate the process because I
post a lot of useless stuff, much of which is useless to everyone but me. On the
other hand, there are people I'm interested in and I _wish_ they'd post more
nonsense. 

Cross-posting everything automatically is a good way to make sure that the
nonsense is distributed as widely as possible.
