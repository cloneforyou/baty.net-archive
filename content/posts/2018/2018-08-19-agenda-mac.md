I&#8217;ve tried using [Agenda][1] for my notes several times and only recently has it &#8220;stuck&#8221;. Here&#8217;s why.

I am not trying to keep _everything_ in it. Agenda doesn&#8217;t work for me as an &#8220;Everything Bucket&#8221; and that&#8217;s what I was trying to use it for. Instead, I&#8217;m using it only for time-based, project-related notes. Anything that involves specific dates or that could benefit from a nice, chronological history becomes a &#8220;project&#8221; in Agenda. Agenda&#8217;s deep calendar integration is super useful for planning and reviewing.

The &#8220;aha!&#8221; moment for me was when I realized that each project in Agenda becomes like a little blog for that project. I love blogs! Thinking of project notes this way is helpful, and has prompted me to take better and more consistent notes for work projects.

I&#8217;m looking forward to a couple of features that should make Agenda even more useful to me.

  1. The ability to archive projects somehow. I&#8217;m currently dumping them into an &#8220;Archive&#8221; category but that&#8217;s not ideal
  2. Inline files and images. I&#8217;m nervous that being able to drop files and images directly into notes will become a slippery slope toward the &#8220;Everything Bucket&#8221; problem, but it certainly can come in handy if used sparingly.
