So here I sit in front of a new-to-me Thinkpad X1 Carbon from 2015. It&#8217;s running Linux. I spent yesterday wiping it of Windows 10 and installing Ubuntu 16.04.

<img class="alignnone size-large wp-image-868" src="/img/2018/01/File-Jan-29-7-12-35-PM-946x1024.jpeg" alt="" width="946" height="1024" srcset="/img/2018/01/File-Jan-29-7-12-35-PM-946x1024.jpeg 946w, /img/2018/01/File-Jan-29-7-12-35-PM-277x300.jpeg 277w, /img/2018/01/File-Jan-29-7-12-35-PM-768x832.jpeg 768w, /img/2018/01/File-Jan-29-7-12-35-PM-750x812.jpeg 750w" sizes="(max-width: 946px) 100vw, 946px" />

The installation process wasn&#8217;t too bad. It was much better than I remember. I opted for Ubuntu because it seems like the easiest path to actually using Linux. I&#8217;m sure there are other options that I&#8217;ll want to try later. First things first.

I like the hardware. It&#8217;s just sort of solid and businesslike. It feels like something I can use and toss around without too much worry. This is partly due to only paying $300 for it, but it&#8217;s mostly because the thing feels like it could take a beating. The screen is nice. Not Retina MBP nice, but nice.

I have to admit that I don&#8217;t mind not feeling like Jony Ive is whispering in my ear every time I open it.

The ThinkPad&#8217;s keyboard took a minute to adapt to, but only a minute. I&#8217;ll tell you right now it&#8217;s miles more enjoyable to type on than my 2016 MBP. The keys have a lot of travel, and they inspire confidence. Oh, and there&#8217;s an actual Escape key, which I&#8217;ve missed.

Let&#8217;s talk about the trackpad. Something is wrong with the trackpad. Something _must_ be wrong with it. Using the trackpad is the most frustrating, inaccurate, unpredictable thing. I&#8217;ll leave final judgment for later, because I assume there&#8217;s a fix out there. There has to be a fix or the whole machine is going to go sailing out a window soon.

I haven&#8217;t explored software much. I&#8217;ve got Emacs (Spacemacs) all set up. That took some finagling, as the bundled package was 24.3 or something and I needed 25.x. The package system and software installs are going to take some getting used to. I expected that. My email is all local via mbsync and viewed in Mu4e. At first I thought managing email in Emacs was a gimmick but it turns out to be pretty great.

Other than Emacs, right now it&#8217;s mostly just Firefox and a terminal. This machine isn&#8217;t intended to replace my Macs. It&#8217;s more of an experiment to see how far I can get. I&#8217;ll keep you posted.
