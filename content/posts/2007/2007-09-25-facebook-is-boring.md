For a time, I thought Facebook would continue to be useful. Indefinitely. With Facebook Apps opening the door to pretty much anything and everyone who's anyone signing up, the sky was the limit. As it turns out Facebook is boring. This is what I get&#8230; 

Bob and Fred are now Friends. Jimmy added the I'm Useless App. You're a Zombie! Janet is single. Compelling stuff, that. 

Maybe I'm just in a bad mood. Okay, no "maybe" about it, but I haven't had anything interesting come through Facebook in weeks. I'd like us all to leave Facebook out of the loop and go back to having blogs and feed readers. That seemed to work pretty well. 

Yes I know, it might be that my friends are boring. But I have friends on Twitter too and that interaction is much more interesting.
