[Brent Simmons][1]:

> Nothing in my entire career has ever matched Frontier for how it enabled me to make things quickly. Things that are difficult in other environments — persistence, debugging, seeing the results of a script — are so simple in Frontier. It’s just how the app works. It still feels to me like it comes from the future.

As a huge fan of Frontier, I love that Brent is doing this. It really was easy magic.
