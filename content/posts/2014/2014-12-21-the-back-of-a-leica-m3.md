This is the back of a Leica M3. Just look at it! Could there be anything simpler? There are no controls; just an ASA indicator and a (world-beating) viewfinder<sup id="fnref-4068-technically"><a href="#fn-4068-technically" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.

I find the whole thing to be a work of art. The only thing better than looking at the back of a Leica M3 is looking _through_ one.
