Steven Johnson [drops an excerpt][1] on us from his book. It's meant as a thought experiment about playing video games vs. reading books, and succeeds. Here's a snippet&#8230;

> 
> 
> "Books are also tragically isolating. While games have for many years engaged the young in complex social relationships with their peers, building and exploring worlds together, books force the child to sequester him or herself in a quiet space, shut off from interaction with other children. These new &#8216;libraries' that have arisen in recent years to facilitate reading activities are a frightening sight: dozens of young children, normally so vivacious and socially interactive, sitting alone in cubicles, reading silently, oblivious to their peers."
