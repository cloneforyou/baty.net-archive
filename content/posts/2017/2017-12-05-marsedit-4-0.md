I don&#8217;t even remember when I first started using [MarsEdit][2], but it was a long time ago. It&#8217;s been a reliable, easy, smart, useful way to post to blogs.

Version 4.0 has been released and it&#8217;s even better. Using MarsEdit is reason enough to stick with&nbsp;WordPress for my blogs (although it works great with [Micro.blog][3] too).
