Like Colin, I question the value of my [Medium membership](https://medium.com/membership).

I became a Medium member the day memberships were announced. Since then, I've
been tempted to cancel, simply because I don't feel I'm missing much if I skip
the "members only" content. The other members-only features are not compelling
on their own, either.

Unlike Colin, I'm opting to keep my membership active -- for now. 

I admire that Medium is trying some new things. I like the _idea_ of Medium. I
can cancel any time, but for now $5/month is a small contribution toward their
experiment.
