I use Safari now, so I don't get the fabulous Web Developer Firefox plugin unless I go way out of my way. There's no replacement that works with Safari, but Allan Jardine's [Design bookmarklet][1] does give us some nice tools.

> _Design_ is a suite of web-design and development assistive tools which can be utilised on any web-page. Encompassing utilities for grid layout, measurement and alignment, _Design_ is a uniquely powerful JavaScript bookmarklet.
