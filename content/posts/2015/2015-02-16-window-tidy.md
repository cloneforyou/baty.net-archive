I've tried many window management apps but none ever seem to stick around for long. The problem I have with most of these types of utilities is that they're very keyboard-centric. When I think about arranging windows I'm generally in mouse mode, not keyboard mode. Moom comes close in that it's triggered when hovering over a window's zoom button but the target is pretty small.

I like [Window Tidy's][1] approach of showing several large targets _after_ I begin dragging a window, since that's when I typically want to arrange things.
