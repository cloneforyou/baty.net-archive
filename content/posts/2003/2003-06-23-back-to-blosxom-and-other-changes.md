Well I moved this weblog back to using [Blosxom][1].

Tough call, since I liked [PHPosxom][2] just fine.
  

  
Truth is, I wanted to play with the large and growing number of
  

  
plugins that are available for Bloxsom. The plugin implementation is
  

  
simple, intuitive and elegant.

I cleaned up a few other things also. I love the buttons from [Steal these
  

  
buttons][3]. Not sure who to credit for the idea, although the first
  

  
place I recall seeing them was [Antipixel][4].

Imagine my suprise when I spotted a nice little button for PHPetal.
  

  
Credit for that goes to [Matthew][5]
