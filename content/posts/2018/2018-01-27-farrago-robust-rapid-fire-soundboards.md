[Rogue Amoeba | Farrago: Robust, rapid-fire soundboards][1]:

> Farrago provides the best way to quickly play sound bites, audio effects, and music clips on your Mac. Podcasters can use Farrago to include musical accompaniment and sound effects during recording sessions

Farrago looks so awesome and easy to use that I bet it comes bundled with the ability to totally ruin a lot of podcasts.
