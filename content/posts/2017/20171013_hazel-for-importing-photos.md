[Thomas Fitzgerald's photo management workflow][1] is reasonably similar to mine. I also process my photos using Lightroom and export them to Photos. I've been manually importing the exported Lightroom photos into Apple Photos and hadn't spent the time to simplify that process. Thomas did it for me!

Thomas uses [Hazel][2] to watch his export folder and automatically import anything new into Photos. I've been using Hazel for years but did not know it could do that. The rules are simple and look like this:

Since my exported photos are only temporary, I also have Hazel delete them when finished. Super handy.
