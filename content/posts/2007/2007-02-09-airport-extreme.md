Apple's new Airport Extreme could not be simpler. Plug it in, run the Airport Utility and viola, 802.11/n. Next thing was to attach a big USB drive to it. I plugged the drive in and up popped a message telling me a new volume was available. Typed in my password and blam, big ole network volume is online for anyone on the LAN. Sweet.
