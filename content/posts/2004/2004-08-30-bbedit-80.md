Years ago I lived in BBEdit. When I moved to a PC I couldn't understand how anyone could edit text at all in Windows. Over the past year I've grown to like [jEdit][1] quite a lot.

I'm switching back to a Mac soon and it looks like [BBEdit 8.0][2] might have addressed what I considered its biggest shortcoming: multiple document management. Can't wait until I get a chance to try it again.
