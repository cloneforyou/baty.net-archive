And speaking of classic technology, I got a new (and my first) [Moleskine][2] today. Apparently it is pronounced mol-a-skeen'-a, so I think I'll just refer to it as My Notebook from now on.

I bought it instead of a PDA. It's lighter, pocketable, more durable, faster to write in, and oh-so-much cooler. Can't play Tetris on it though, as far as I can figure.

Nothing like a dash of uber-cool beatnik elitism for keeping one's grocery list!
