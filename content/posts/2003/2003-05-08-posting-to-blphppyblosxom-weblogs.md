![Posting to weblogs][1]

I'm working on a PHP app to assist in posting to blosxom-compatible weblogs. I know, I know, the whole point of blosxom is to use the file system. Sometimes though, it's just easier to fill out a quick html form.

Features implemented:
  


  * Integrated image uploads
  * Category selection (single level)
  * Automatic (guessed) filenames
  * Back-dating stories

Discuss </p> 

document.write("("  <ins>ct_19_WHSf </ins> ")");
  

  
</a>
