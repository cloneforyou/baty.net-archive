It used to be that Apple keynotes made me lust after a new phone. I guess technically they still do, but today's event only made me want the new camera. At least it comes with a phone!

Seriously though, the iPhone camera is good enough for 90% of what most people need in a camera. Me included, if I'm being honest.
