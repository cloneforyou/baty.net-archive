I first saw [Songs from the Second Floor][1] about 2 months ago. I thought it was complete nonsense and hated every minute of it. Well at least all 20 minutes that I managed to watch. Maybe I didn't get it. Maybe I wasn't in the mood for some stupid and absurd visual poem presented in Swedish.

I gave it another shot last night and have completely reversed my opinion. It's a _wonderfully_ absurd visual poem presented in Swedish. Dark, strange, funny, morbid and really brilliant. It really could be the bastard love child of Fellini, David Lynch and Monty Python. My guess is that most people will never see this film, and most of the ones who do will sit there with furrowed brow, fidgeting until finally turning it off in frustration.
