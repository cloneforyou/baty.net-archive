In [iCame, iSaw, iCaved][1] David Carr of the NYT seems to think there's a problem with the consistent pricing model of iTunes and suggests that variable pricing would be fine&#8230; 

> The Web, after all, can easily enable infinitely customized pricing. eBay proved that people will not only track prices closely, but act in their own consuming self-interest.

eBay!? Let's see a show of hands, who likes eBay? That's what I thought. 

He also bitches that his 80GB iPod is now somehow obsolete. People need to stop demanding new products then complaining when they show up.
