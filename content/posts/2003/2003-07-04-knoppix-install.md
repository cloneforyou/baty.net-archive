[Knoppix][1] is
  

  
a very complete Linux distribution which runs entirely from a CD. It
  

  
does a great job of detecting hardware and comes configured to run
  

  
KDE. Just put in the CD, reboot and you're running Linux with all
  

  
sorts of software to play with. It never touches your hard drive, so
  

  
when you're finished, just remove the CD, reboot and you're back to
  

  
using boring old Windows.&nbsp; But did you know you can also install it
  

  
directly from the CD to your hard drive? I was trying to install
  

  
Debian 3 on an older PC at my house and it was having trouble running
  

  
KDE and the sound card wouldn't work. With nothing to lose, I popped
  

  
in Knoppix 3.2, typed /usr/bin/kpx-hdinstall and followed the
  

  
instructions. In no time I just rebooted into a working Debian Linux
  

  
system. It detected all of my hardware just fine. Nice.
