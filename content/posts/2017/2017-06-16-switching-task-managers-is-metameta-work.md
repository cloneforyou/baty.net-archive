title: Switching task managers is meta-meta work

As someone who frequently switches task managers, I can relate to this. The
problem is that switching task managers is just another form of meta work. It's
_meta_-meta work.

I've rationalized changing task managers in more ways than there are task
managers. It's always some feature or other that I _need_ and the current tool
doesn't have. Or it's that the iOS version is so great. Or it's that it needs
to be cross-platform, or any number of other "reasons". 

Fact is, I switch task managers when I get bored and doing so is way more fun
than doing actual work.
