I have a little Olympus Stylus Epic which I take nearly everywhere. It seems to have developed a crack or chip somewhere which is showing itself as a dark hairline at the edge of every frame. I like the camera so much that I started looking for another one. Of course in the process I discovered the [Olympus XA][1]. Now **this** is a pocketable point and shoot. 6 element fixed 2.8 Zuiko lens, coupled rangefinder, aperture priority and tabbed focusing.

I bought one.

I don't think $50 is too much for this, according to Modern Photography, 1979&#8230;

**Update:** It seems that the XA has somewhat of a cult following. I love cults!
