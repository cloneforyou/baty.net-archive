Confined to sex, we pressed against
  

  
The limits of the sea:
  

  
I saw there were no oceans left
  

  
For scavengers like me.
  

  
I made it to the forward deck.
  

  
I blessed our remnant fleet &#194;&#8211;
  

  
And then consented to be wrecked,
  

  
A Thousand Kisses Deep.

&#8212;Leonard Cohen
