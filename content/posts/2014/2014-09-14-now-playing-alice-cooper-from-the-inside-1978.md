I normally love concept albums, and onne in which Alice Cooper sings about life in an asylum sounds like a great idea. It ends up being interesting, if mediocre. I love the line "I just can't get these damn wrists to bleed" but then there's Nurse Rozetta:

> Nurse Rozetta I won't let her
  
> Catch me peering down her sweater
  
> Fantasizing silk suspenders on her thighs
  
> Nurse Rozetta make me better
  
> Secretly my eyes undress her
  
> Let me feel your tongue depressor

I was 14 when "From the Inside" was released and it would've been pretty cool then I suppose.
