Every so often I consider &#x201c;going dark&#x201d; on the Internet. Meaning I drop out of Twitter, Facebook, etc. just to get away from the noise for a while. It never lasts because I _love_ sharing stuff Facebook and Twitter and Tumblr. Even so, I think it&#x2019;s time to try staying away for a while. 

I&#x2019;ll be posting here at baty.net and probably the jackbaty.com blog but otherwise I hope to under-share on the usual sites for a while. Miss me!

UPDATE: That lasted like 4 hours. Shut up.
