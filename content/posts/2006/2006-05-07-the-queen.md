I was forced to watch [Last Holiday][1] with Jessica last night. By forced I mean that she said "Please!?" It's nice when you just know a movie is going to suck &#8211; and then doesn't. Queen Latifah totally saves the thing. I like her, and other than a contrived and misplaced ski hill scene, I liked the movie.
