It hurts a little, but I&#8217;ve begun selling off my lovely Fuji cameras and lenses.

I fell in love with Fuji when they released the original X100. I loved that camera. I still have it, but it&#8217;s in a drawer somewhere. 

Since then I&#8217;ve used the original X-Pro, the X-Pro2, X-T1, X100T, and X-T3. I have also collected a number of the finest Fujinon lenses.

The winds started to shift with the purchase of a Leica Q a couple years ago. I&#8217;ve used film Leicas for years, but my experience with Leica digital cameras was limited and not enjoyable. The Q changed that. The Leica Q was a full-frame camera with a fabulous 28mm Summilux attached. It was a pleasure to use and the images were fantastic.

Then, finally, came the [M10-P][1] and my interest moved to the Leica M system for both film and digital. In order to salve the injuries to my bank account, I&#8217;ve decided to sell off most of the Fuji system.

At the time of writing this, all that remains are the three lenses. [Here&#8217;s my eBay link][2] if you&#8217;re interested.

What am I keeping? For now, I&#8217;m hanging on to the X-T3 for when I really need faster operation and/or auto-focus. I also use it for <a href="https://copingmechanism.com/2020/scanning-film-negatives-with-a-digital-camera/" data-type="post" data-id="540">scanning film negatives</a>. And if I ever want high-quality video, the X-T3 is great for that. The only lenses I&#8217;m keeping are the kit zoom, which is fine, and the 7artisans macro for film scans.

So I guess that I&#8217;m not _completely_ off the Fuji system, but it&#8217;s not currently my focus, as it were.
