{{< figure src="shelley-and-jeff.jpg" title="Shelly and Jeff at JT's" >}}

Our friends Shelley and Jeff are two of the very few people we&#8217;ll (carefully) meet with during the pandemic.

I snapped this while having dinner. It&#8217;s a nice portrait of them, but what stands out is the chip in Jeff&#8217;s hand. He _loves_ the restaurant&#8217;s &#8220;spicy chicken nacho dip&#8221;. He also loves salt, and will often add salt to each chip full of dip. I warn him that I worry his heart is going to explode and he smiles and nods in agreement while he adds more salt.

That chip is an accidental detail that makes the photo meaningful to me.
