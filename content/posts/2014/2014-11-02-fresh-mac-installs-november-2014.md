  I just replaced my 5-year <img class="alignright wp-image-3874" src="/img/2014/11/Apple_-_iMac_with_Retina_5K-display.png" alt="Apple_-_iMac_with_Retina_5K display" width="262" height="187" srcset="/img/2014/11/Apple_-_iMac_with_Retina_5K-display.png 642w, /img/2014/11/Apple_-_iMac_with_Retina_5K-display-300x214.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 262px) 100vw, 262px" />old 27&#8243; iMac with a beautiful new 27&#8243; Retina iMac. Normally it would be best to restore from a Time Machine backup but I decided that with 5 years of crud built up I would start from scratch. I'm sure I'll hate myself later.

  It's fun to rethink what software I <i>need</i> every now and then. Here's the list of things I've installed so far.
</p>

  * 1Password
  * Dropbox
  * PopClip
  * TextExpander
  * Bittorrent Sync
  * Hazel
  * Xcode
  * Homebrew
  * zsh (and oh-my-zsh)
  * Mutt
  * tmux
  * Skitch
  * iTerm2
  * Vim
  * Better Rename 9
  * Acorn
  * Tinderbox
  * DEVONthink Pro Office
  * TheBrain (and so also Java)
  * Day One
  * Vuescan
  * Clarify
  * Evernote
  * Interarchy
  * Reeder
  * Slack
  * Vuescan
  * Lightroom
  * Photoshop CC
  * Capture One Pro
  * Photo Mechanic
  * BBEdit
  * Taskwarrior
  * Sonos
  * YNAB
  * Final Cut Pro

It's all mostly the usual suspects. No surprise there. I was surprised by Mutt and Vim, since I swore off terminal apps again recently. Also, Evernote is taking a more prominent spot in my workflow lately. Or I should say, again.

  It feels great to start fresh, even though it eats up a couple of days.
