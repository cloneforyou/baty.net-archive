For those who care, [Textpattern][1] 1.19g has been released. There's a few nice new features, but the big deal is that it's now fully GPL'ed. This means that no Movable Type bait and switch nonsense can happen. The upgrade on this site went flawlessly and I've also imported about 700 entries from my old Movable Type installation. Onward.
