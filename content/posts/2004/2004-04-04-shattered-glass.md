The best movies are those you've never heard of. Why is that? [Shattered Glass][1] is one of them. This one kept me riveted the entire time. It's the true story of Stephen Glass, young hot-shot reporter for the prestigious _New Republic_ magazine, and the eventual discovery that he was fabricating most of his stories.

Turns out that Hayden Christensen isn't half bad as an actor. We can probably forgive him that little Star Wars thing.
