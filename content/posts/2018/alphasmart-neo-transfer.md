title: AlphaSmart Neo File Transfer
---

To transfer a file from the AlphaSmart Neo2 to my Mac, I connect it via USB and hit send. The AlphaSmart sends one character at a time to whatever app is frontmost. Terribly slow, but I get a kick out of watching it happen.

Here's a quick capture of the Neo sending some text to Emacs on my Mac.
