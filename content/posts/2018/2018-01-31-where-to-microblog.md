Where should I keep a microblog? I have gone back and forth on this since the early days of Tumblr and I&#8217;m still not sure I&#8217;ve resolved it. Pardon me while I think this through.

I define a &#8220;microblog&#8221; post as something that does not need a title: short, Twitter-like bursts or snapshot images with a brief caption are perfect examples. Link posts are somewhere in between, as they benefit from a title but don&#8217;t need one.

The concern is that short, title-less posts or images will somehow clutter up my precious blog. This is of course nonsense, because my blog is nowhere near precious. And by precious I mean:

> derogatory: affectedly concerned with elegant or refined behavior, language, or manners: his exaggerated, precious manner. 

(This doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not priceless to me. It very much is.)

My blog has never been &#8220;serious&#8221;. I don&#8217;t worry about sticking to publishing timelines or making sure I&#8217;ve thought everything through with each post. I usually don&#8217;t even edit before posting. I reserve that for the &#8220;oh shit!&#8221; moments _after_ clicking &#8220;Publish&#8221;.

I like [Dave Winer][1]&#8217;s definition:

> &#8220;Blogging is thinking aloud into an outliner that has a Publish button on it.&#8221; 

That&#8217;s more my style.

I guess I&#8217;ve found my answer, then. Microblog posts are going to remain right here at jack.baty.net for now. And I&#8217;m going to let them flow right through the home page with everything else.

I am, however, leaving microblog posts out of the main RSS feed, so if you don&#8217;t like the noise, that&#8217;s one way to filter it out.

Oh, and if you don&#8217;t have a blog or just want a microblog, please consider [Manton Reece][2]&#8217;s [Micro.blog][3] service. It&#8217;s terrific.

Thanks for listening.
