I love the fact that in Firefox I can change the font size, even those set using pixels, by simply hitting Control-plus or Control-minus. Given the trend to use microscopic fonts because they look better when you're putting a bunch of letters together to form words and such, the ole ctrl-+ is handy. The trouble in Firefox is that there doesn't seem to be a way to reset fonts to their "normal" size. It's been there all along. Just use Control-0 (zero).
