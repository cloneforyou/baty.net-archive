(The possessive, not the contraction!) I've been keeping a weblog of one form or another since, well, for a long time. The first one was a basic custom app written in ColdFusion sometime around 1997 or 1998. You may have noticed that I'm a bit flighty when it comes to software, so who knows what I'll be blogging with next week? The downside of all this moving around is that I seem to have lost a great deal of history in the process. I was troubled by the fact that there was no sign of any posts before this year on the server. Yesterday I suddenly remembered that I used to keep a Blogger blog a few years ago. Sure enough, it was still there. I exported the entries and imported them into Movable type. Viola! 2000 and 2001 are partially restored. I still seem to be missing most of 2002, but I think that may be due to my messing up the dates while importing my Blosxom files. Now if I could just find the earlier stuff.
