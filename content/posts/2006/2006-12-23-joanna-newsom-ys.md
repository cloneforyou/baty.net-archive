&ldquo;It's a harp fer chrissakes!&rdquo; was my reaction each time I'd read another reviewer fawning over Joanna Newsom's \_Ys\_. What use could I have for a silly retro dandelion-and-fairies harp playing waif? Armed with an iTunes gift certificate and being a sucker for all things recommended, I decided to see what the fuss was about. Three minutes into the opening &ldquo;Emily&rdquo; I knew I was listening to something unique. Twenty minutes later, after &ldquo;Sawdust & Diamonds&rdquo; I realized I'd for the most part stopped breathing. 

The album is on it's 4th time through and I don't see any reason to listen to anything else just yet. Like listening to someone read an ancient fairy tale while dreaming, it's completely mesmerizing.
