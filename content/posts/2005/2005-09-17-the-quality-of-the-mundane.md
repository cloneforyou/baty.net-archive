I have been replacing the mundane with the exceptional.

It started slowly, as I began to realize that little things _do_ matter.&nbsp; This is not about irrationally spending too much on stupid, obvious things. It is about removing as many of the boring, crappy, ugly items that we use/touch/eat/carry every day and replacing them with things that are well-built and beautiful.

The opportunities are endless, but beware. Eventually **everything** becomes something that could, nay, **should**, be better &#8211; and damn if I'm not going to find it!

The following list contains things that I either have or would like to, well, upgrade.

</p> 

  * Writing instruments (these used to be called "ink pens"). I received a [Montblanc Meisterst&#252;ck][1] some 12 years ago as a gift and still use it every day. 


  * Paper. I like [Moleskine notebooks][2] and [Levenger 3&#215;5 index cards][3]


  * Music Player. Apple's [iPod][4], of course


  * Books. Hardcover, signed if possible


  * Cameras. [Leica][5], but they better hurry up with the digital M. (My black M6TTL is for sale, BTW).


  * Computers. I completely love my [iMac][6].


  * Drinks. I like [Scotch][7] &#8211; a lot.


  * Knives.&nbsp; [J.A. Henckels][8]


  * Clothes. All of my clothes are cheap and usually wrinkled, so it looks like I'm not finished yet.


  * Phones. Haven't found a cell phone I like. Too many features and not enough phone. For the desk, I'll still take the old [500 rotary][9] for sheer dead-simple design and last-forever quality.


  * Bags. I have [Domke][10] bags and love them. Get canvas, don't be tempted by the new-fangled "ballistic nylon". I hear good things about [Crumpler bags][11] (but their site sucks)
</ul> 

I'll bet there's more. And of course the above list should come in handy for Christmas and birthdays as well.
