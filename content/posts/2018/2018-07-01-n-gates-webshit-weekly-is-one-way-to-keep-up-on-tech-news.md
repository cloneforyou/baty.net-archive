title: n-gate’s “Webshit Weekly” is one way to keep up on tech news

[n-gate.com,s Webshit weekly.][1]:

> Some DIY electronics-repair people write a hit piece about a company that makes difficult-to-repair products. Hackernews can no longer ignore the fact that their favorite computer manufacturer hasn’t manufactured a useful computer in several years, and spends yet another afternoon mourning the death of the person who made the trains run on time. In the end, the consensus is that they’ll only spend a few thousand more dollars on this shit, and if it doesn’t get better, they’ll go buy Macbook clones from Dell instead.

When I’m in the mood for I’m-better-and-smarter-than-you meta-snark, I can always rely on n-gate.
