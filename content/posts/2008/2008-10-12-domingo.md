<span class="drop_cap">D</span>omingo Corpus is a talented musician and a great guy. We saw he and his band play a dinner show last night at The Vernier in Port Huron. Really good stuff, and I'm not just saying that because he's my girlfriend's brother in law.

You can hear more on his "MySpace page":http://profile.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=user.viewprofile&friendid=81908124.
