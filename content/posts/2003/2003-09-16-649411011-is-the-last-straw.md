As if my hot and spikey hatred of Verisign wasn't hot and spikey enough&#8230;.

As of Monday morning, Sept 15th, Verisign has apparently taken it upon themselves to add a wildcard A record to the TLD zones for .com and .net. The IP is 64.94.110.11, which resolves to sitefinder.verisign.com. That's right, this means all mistyped domain names go directly to a page on one of Verisign's servers. Bastards. They don't get another penny from me or anyone I can convince to do the same.
