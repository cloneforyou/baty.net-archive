Some advice&#8230; never offer to pick up your daughter and four of her teenage friends from a teen dance club. The were like, crazy and were like, bouncing off the ceiling and like, giggling like Soooo&#8230;.Much.&nbsp; And like, saying things like&#8230;

"OMG! He was dancing like a noodle. I was like, dude, don't be a noodle."

"He was like, singing in my ear while we were dancing. But like, LOUD! and I was like, dude, that hurts my head."

"I was like &#8216;Yo, what up?' and he was like &#8216;Yo, nuttin.' He's so hot!"

"Dude, I hate that camel toe song!"

And as for me, I've gotta go, like, slit my wrists.
