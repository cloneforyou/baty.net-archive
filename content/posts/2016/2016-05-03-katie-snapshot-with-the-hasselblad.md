A Hasselblad 500-series camera is not suitable for snapshots, but I keep taking
snapshots with them. This photo of Katie was taken using the 503CXi with the
150mm Sonnar. She's 17 years old but never seems to stand still, so I had to
follow her around and wait for a break in the action. This is the best I could
do. Still, I love the way the lenses render. And I love the square format.
