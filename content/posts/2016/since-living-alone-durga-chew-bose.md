I've lived alone for quite a few years now. I'm not lonely, but am frequently
alone. This is my default--my preference, given the choice.

Being alone much of the time gives me room. Room to explore. Room to "stay in
and excitedly ad-lib doing nothing at all". I love that last phrase, and doing
nothing at all is my favorite thing to do.

Or it was.

I'm learning that not having any constraints with my free time leaves me
wandering a little too aimlessly. I drift more than I _do_. I'm learning that
one of the things I seem to enjoy most is actually making me less happy; less
productive.

I have some ideas on how to change this, but they're secret, for now.
