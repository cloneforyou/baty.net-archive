> The designer that knows CSS can't update some colours in GitHub without breaking half of the tests. The Product manager can't replace a bunch of words in a page without figuring out the PropTypes of the map component. The accessibility expert can't replace divs with buttons because the visual regression testing says that Opera mini in Windows Phone 6.5 renders a border about them and we can't merge changes until it all goes green. The frontend dev can't implement an accordion (honestly, that one might be for the best) because the guy who's super into types won't let her store state outside of redux.

I don't mean to continue coming off as an old curmudgeon that can't keep up, but I worry that the way we're building the web these days is bad for some portion of our future.
