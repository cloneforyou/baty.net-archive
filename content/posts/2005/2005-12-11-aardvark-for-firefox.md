[Aardvark][1] is a killer Firefox extension which allows you to see how pages are created, one block at a time. There's a slew of keyboard shortcuts once it's running which you can use to drill down, remove elements, etc. It works as a nice complement to some of the features of the developer's extensions you're probably already using.
