Nielsen's [latest
  

  
Alertbox][1] discusses possible answers to questions that repeatedly
  

  
come up when trying to sell usability. Like "What should you say when
  

  
clients complain that there's no reason to test the design since they
  

  
hired you because you supposedly know how to create good websites in
  

  
the first place?"
