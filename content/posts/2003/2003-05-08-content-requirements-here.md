Originally, I was only going to post "important" development or
  

  
net-related topics around here. That hasn't exactly panned out, since I
  

  
seem to put just about anything I feel like up here lately. So, instead
  

  
of feeling guilty about it, I've decided that anything goes.

Follow along if you like.
