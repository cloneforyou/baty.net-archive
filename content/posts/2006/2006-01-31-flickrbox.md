While looking for a Greasemonkey script to kill IntelliTXT, I ran into [Flickrbox](<http://www.leftbrained.co.uk/code/flickrbox>), which uses everyone's new darling [Lightbox.js](<http://www.huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/>) to enhance viewing thumbnails on Flickr. It works as advertised and I like it.
