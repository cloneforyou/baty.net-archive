The most fun I've had watching a movie this year was during [Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind][1].&nbsp; I'll admit I was confused when the opening credits (finally) began, but knowing it was a Charlie Kaufman script forced me to shrug that off and stay with it. And what a reward for doing so!

Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet both give what I think are their best performances ever. Carrey makes one silly face &#8211; just one &#8211; throughout the entire film.

Screenwriter Charlie Kaufman continues to be almost painfully clever, but stops just short of being a showoff (see Adaptation). The story is part love story, part science fiction and is, in keeping with the latest trends, told in reverse. It's cleverly shot by director Michel Gondry. There really is a lot to like here.
