My lawn sucks &#8211; what remains of it. The result of Oak trees, dogs and neglect, I'm now left with several greenish clumps helping to break up the otherwise unfettered expanse of dirt and weeds.

I water, mow, and pay too much for a service which, as far as I can tell, comes around once every 6 weeks or so just to stick a small sign in my front yard and an invoice in my mailbox.

Apparently, I've been doing it all wrong. At least according to [this article from richsoil.com][1].
