I just deleted 14,247 tweets going back to 2006[^fn:1].

Why? Aren't I supposed to archive and keep everything forever? Yes, and that's what I did. I downloaded my entire Twitter archive before deleting anything. I still have a local copy of everything.

I kept all tweets from 2019 and a bunch of my favorites going back to 2007. Eventually I'll maintain a rolling set of maybe 90 days and delete everything older than that.

Data is becoming a liability. I'm not worried about being called out on things I said ten years ago, but having everything I've muttered since 2006 on someone else's servers feels icky and this is one place where I don't see the harm in getting rid of it.

[^fn:1]: I used the paid version of [Twitter Archive Eraser](https://martani.github.io/Twitter-Archive-Eraser/#)
