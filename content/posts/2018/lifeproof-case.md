title: Lifeproof Case for iPhone
---

I've been going without a case on my iPhone X for a while now. I love a caseless phone. However, I felt I needed to baby it too much so I did a 180 and ordered a [Lifeproof FRÄ’](https://www.lifeproof.com/en-us/iphone-x/fre-for-iphone-x/lpfr-apl-iphn17.html). I thought it would be nice to play more fast and loose with the phone, and the Lifeproof is supposed to be all sorts of tough. And it's waterproof to boot.

I was wrong. I put the case on and knew immediately that I'd made a mistake. It ruined one of the best things about the X...the _feel_ of it. The case felt like cheap plastic. Like something I'd grabbed out of the impulse bin at Best Buy. I didn't expect that, given all the great reviews. I also didn't like having a screen cover. It was very reflective and felt _off_ somehow.

Anyway, I'm sure it's a fine case for someone who needs something like it. I sent mine back.
