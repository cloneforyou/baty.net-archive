Consider this my semi-regular reminder to caption your photos. Even though
Google Photos can figure out _what_ is in photos, it can't (yet) know why or
what it means. Take a few minutes and add a caption to at least some of your
photos. 

And while you're at it, print a few of them. Your grandkids will thank you.
