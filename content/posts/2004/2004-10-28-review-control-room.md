[Control Room][1]: A film about the differences between American and Arab journalism before and during the war in Iraq. Absolutely riveting. Watching journalists from Al Jazeera and the US networks sitting across from each other and commenting on (then current) events both puts things into and takes things out of perspective. One of the best examples is the reporting by Al Jazeera of the toppling of Sadaam's statue in Baghdad. Instead of the cheering "crowd" we were shown, it looks more like a half-dozen teenagers following a script.&nbsp; I'll never see the news in the same way again.
