After all the fuss I’ve been making about blogging tools (mostly to myself), I find that Blosxom (pronounced “bloss-um” I believe) has gone 1.0.

It’s unique because it uses the file system for rendering and displaying posts. Create a text file in your blog directory on the server and it’s automatically listed and linked. Pages can be static or dynamic. The “flavour” system (templates) are simple.

Installing now…
