I double-click things on web pages. Not to "launch" anything or in any way make something happen, it's just a nervous habit. Except on the [NYT][1] site. They've seen fit to cause a dictionary window to open whenever I double-click on a word. It annoys the hell outta me. Thanks to Greasemonkey I can continue to read the Times without wanting to kill anyone (mostly.). Install [this Greasemonkey script][2] and all will be well again.
