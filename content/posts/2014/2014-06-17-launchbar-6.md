[Launchbar][1] was the first app launcher I loved on the Mac. I'd used Quicksilver prior to that but it was buggy and we never got along well. Launchbar was awesome and has been around forever.

However, when [Alfred][2] came along I was seduced by how pretty it was and eventually switched. Alfred has been great, but it always felt to me like a pretty-but-lesser substitute for Launchbar, so I was happy to see that Launchbar 6 was released recently.

Launchbar 6 solves the "pretty problem" nicely. It looks great. It also now incorporates "Powerful custom, script-based actions" which should do nicely to replace the few Alfred Workflows I rely upon. It's great and I'm happy to be back.

If you're interested in Launchbar or launchers in general, Shawn Blanc has written [long, detailed review and history lesson][3] which is well worth a read.
