I've had [Cygwin][1] installed on my
  

  
laptop for a couple months now, but I've only recently begun using it.
  

  
It all started with discovering that rxvt can be used as a terminal,
  

  
replacing the god-awful DOS-like window that is the default. I'm now
  

  
running VIM, rsync, mutt, SSH and more right here on my Windows machine.

It's cool, and it helps alleviate some of the TiBook envy I've been
  

  
experiencing ever since [Steve][2] and
  

  
[Bryan][3] got their shiny new
  

  
machines running OS X.
