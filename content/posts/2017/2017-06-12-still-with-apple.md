It has become trendy to question our allegiance to Apple.

There are certainly times I wonder why I continue to use Apple products. Between a bunch of little things always breaking and my disappointment with the new MacBook Pro I grow frustrated and threaten to leave Apple completely. I become curious about how the other half (or two-thirds, or whatever) live. I like to shake things up now and then, so this all leads to hedging my bets against Apple.

To this end, I've been using fewer Mac-only apps, more web apps, and have gone all-in with Emacs and Org Mode. You know, just in case one day I decide to switch to Linux or Windows. In recent months I've been _this_ close to buying a fast Linux laptop and an Android phone, just to see how it would feel.

Fact is, that's crazy talk. I can't imagine I'd ever actually switch. Avoiding everything that macOS and iOS have to offer, just in case I change my mind some day, seems foolish.

My use of the iPad Pro has increased, and the updates in iOS 11 have cemented that trend. The relatively seamless integration between my Mac and my iPad is pretty compelling. 

So, for now I'm clearing my head of any thoughts of switching platforms and will be moving my stuff into my favorite Mac and iOS apps.

For now, those are:

- [TheBrain](https://thebrain.com) for managing projects and files and connections
- [DEVONthink](https://devontechnologies.com) for storing everything in an eminently searchable way
- [Things](https://culturedcode.com) for managing tasks. This one is new, and so far I like the v3 upgrade.
- Apple Mail for email. At least until I run into too many things I don't like.
- [BBEdit](https://barebones.com) for text processing and editing
- [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) for taking notes. I may end up using Apple Notes or nvAlt's replacement but for now, Bear is pretty great.

My concern is that as great as the above apps are, Org Mode really is the best all-around productivity tool I've ever used. I may end up missing it too much to leave out of the rotation, and once it's back in the rotation, it eats everything else.
