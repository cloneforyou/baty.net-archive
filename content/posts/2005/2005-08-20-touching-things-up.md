My dad, godluvim, just stopped at my house and took all of the wood parts off my old gas grill. Says he was bored and thought he'd strip and restain them &#8211; make it look goodasnew.

This of course coincided with a wave of guilt and regret. Why didn't I do that? Why is my lawn a mess and when am I going to clean the spare room in the basement? Am I just completely lazy?

I calmed down and looked at what I've done so far today.

</p> 

  * Got up, showered, made breakfast, cleaned the kitchen and checked my email.


  * Read all of my RSS feeds


  * Posted a short blog entry


  * Cleaned up my [Ruby][1] script which updates our [Darcs][2] repositories and synchronizes them to a backup location


  * Wrote rationale and design goals for re-developing our in-house content management system using [Rails][3]


  * Began a project template in [Circus Ponies Notebook][4]


  * Researched [fast, wide prime lens options][5] for my 20D


  * Began work on a script for mirroring our Darcs repositories to [Subversion][6] repositories so we can continue using [Trac][7]
</ul> 

It's 1:20 in the afternoon, so no, I don't think I'm lazy after all. It just looks that way from the _real world_. I just have a different way of touching things up, is all. Now, about that laundry&#8230;
