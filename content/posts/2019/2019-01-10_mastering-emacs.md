I recently had an epiphany about Emacs key bindings...

> The most compelling reason I’ve found yet for switching to the “normal” Emacs keybindings is that many of the same bindings work everywhere on a Mac. This just occurred to me and now I have to decide if I want to lose weeks of my life to making the switch.

So now I'm [re-reading Mastering Emacs](https://rudimentarylathe.org/#Book%3A%20Mastering%20Emacs) with the goal of building everything from scratch and learning the "Emacs Way" of doing things. 

My entry into Emacs was via [Spacemacs](https://spacemacs.org) and [evil-mode](https://github.com/emacs-evil/evil) so I have many old habits to break.

I guess I'll be losing those weeks after all.
