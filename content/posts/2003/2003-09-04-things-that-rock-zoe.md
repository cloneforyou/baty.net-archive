> It has been fully indexed to the last significant bit. Information have been extracted. Relationships have been made. Links have been discovered. Information was put in context. Normalized. A knowledge base has been build. For you. Automatically. Accessible at akey stroke. When you need it. Without you moving any single one of yourbusy fingers to write some arcane filtering rules to some soon to beunmanageable folder structure (see "Intertwingularity") in somecumbersome proprietary email system.
