[FEED: Christopher Locke interview with Ian Clarke of Freenet fame.][1]

Clarke: "Although I think it is important to stress that Freenet was not designed with the issue of copyright in mind. It was not designed to be the next Napster. It was actually a journalist who first said to me, "Hey, well couldn't you do the same thing as Napster, but better?" But in terms of the actual genesis of Freenet, I wasn't thinking about MP3s, I wasn't thinking about music, I was thinking about freedom of speech."
