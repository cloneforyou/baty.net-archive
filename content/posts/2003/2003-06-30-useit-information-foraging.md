The latest alertbox, [: Information
  

  
Foraging: Why Google Makes People Leave Your Site Faster][1], claims
  

  
that "Information foraging is the most important concept to emerge
  

  
from Human-Computer Interaction research since 1993."

And correctly, in my opinion, states that "&#8230;it's healthy to remember
  

  
that users are selfish, lazy, and ruthless in applying their
  

  
cost-benefit analyses."
