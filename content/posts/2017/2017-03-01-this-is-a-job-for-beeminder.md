title: This Is a Job for Beeminder
---


I ran into the word Akrasia again recently and it reminded me of myself:

> Akrasia (*əˈkreɪzɪə*; Greek ἀκρασία, “lacking command”).
>
> …a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one’s better
> judgement. The adjectival form is “akratic”

I think about this sort of thing in January, naturally. I had first
heard of Akrasia when I was actively using
[Beeminder](https://www.beeminder.com/) a few years ago. I’m not sure
why I quit using Beeminder (well I do, but I’ll never admit it). Since
I’ve become fatter and more out of shape than I’ve been in years, I’m
firing up Beeminder again to see if it helps curb my akratic tendencies.
