[Au Hasard Balthazar][1] is the finest film you're likely to see this year &#8211; maybe ever.

.

When released in 1966, Jean-Luc Godard apparently called it "The world in an hour and a half" and I can't think of a better review.

It is a story of a donkey named Balthazar but it is not really about him at all. It can be frustrating, slow, unusual and cold, but it's also beautiful, enigmatic, and deeply, deeply moving.&nbsp; _Au Hasard Balthazar_ is the reason I watch movies
