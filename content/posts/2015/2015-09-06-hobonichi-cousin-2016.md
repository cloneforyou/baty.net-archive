For the past three years I’ve used the highly-regarded [Hobonichi Techo planner][1]. It’s a great little planner, but perhaps _too_ little.

My notebook binder of choice in recent months has been a [Roterfaden][2] and it’s quickly become a favorite. It’s the perfect (A5) size, built wonderfully, and the clip mechanism is clever and useful. In it I’ve kept an [Apica Premium C.D. notebook][3] and the combination is great. I’d been carrying my little Techo separately, which worked but wasn’t ideal.

Then I discovered the [“Cousin” version of the Hobonichi][4]. The Cousin is A5 and just as awesome as the littler Techo. The only problem is that it doesn’t come in an edition that’s been translated to English. I decided to try one anyway. I bought the Spring 2015 version and love it.<figure>

Everything is in Japanese but that’s fine since I’ve learned to recognize the symbols for each day. Not a problem. The Cousin fits perfectly in the Roterfaden. I love the combination and have ordered the 2016 Cousin.
