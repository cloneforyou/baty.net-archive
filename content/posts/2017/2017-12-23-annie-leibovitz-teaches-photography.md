A [Masterclass featuring Annie Leibovitz][1] looked like a great idea, so I paid the $90 and signed up.

I enjoyed listening to her perspective and insights on shooting portraits. She works hard on concepts, plans meticulously, and has a &#8220;vision&#8221; for what and who she&#8217;s shooting. The class, however, felt more like a 2-hour documentary than a class. I can&#8217;t recommend it at the $90 price. On the other hand, if you&#8217;ve already paid the $180 annual subscription fee for the &#8220;All Access Pass&#8221;, the class is included and is well worth your time.
