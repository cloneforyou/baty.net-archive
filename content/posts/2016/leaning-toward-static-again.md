I hate myself sometimes. 

I swore I would never change the blog engine (currently Wordpress) used for
[baty.net](https://baty.net) but I'm enjoying the benefits of Hugo and thus a
totally static site at notes.baty.net so much that I'm teetering on trying the
conversion again. Maybe I'll just see how it feels and only publish if
everything goes perfectly.

Yeah right.

Here's the thing, I only want one blog. I keep making more of them simply as a
way to try some new toy, but I only want content on one. Need to make the call.

**Update**: See? I did it again.
