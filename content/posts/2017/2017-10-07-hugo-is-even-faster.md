I slimmed down the templates and Hugo renders my site even faster:

```
Built site for language en:
0 draft content
0 future content
0 expired content
2272 regular pages created
458 other pages created
2 non-page files copied
114 paginator pages created
216 tags created
8 categories created
total in 1290 ms
```

That's [down from around 2600ms](/2017/hugo-is-very-fast/)
