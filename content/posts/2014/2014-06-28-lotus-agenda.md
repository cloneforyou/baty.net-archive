Someone recently mentioned their love for (and continued use of) [Lotus Agenda][1]. My ears perked up because Agenda was one of those apps so completely _loved_ by the people using it that they've been whining about its demise for nearly 20 years. Curious, I thought I'd see if it was still possible to run Agenda, on my Mac, and was surprised to learn that it's not only possible, but relatively easy to do.

The key is to run it using [DOSBox][2]. I know, DOSBox is geared mostly toward running games so there's no printing, etc. but it's small, easy to set up and so far works fine. I copied a pre-installed version of Agenda (downloaded [here][3]) to a local folder. Then, after launching DOSBox, I mount the directory like this&#8230;

`mount c /Users/jbaty/Dropbox/Agenda`

Once that was done it was simply a matter of running the file from within DOSBox to install, then typing "agenda". I've been playing with it for hours now and it's easy to see why so many people loved it. It reminds me a little of Tinderbox in that you can put stuff in right away and then organize it later.

I'm going to try using Agenda for a couple of weeks as my primary planner, just to see how it feels in real life.

Mitch Kapor, Agenda's original author, [said something similar][6]&#8230;

The antique car comparison feels about right. I'm not expecting to run my life in Agenda, but playing with old software like this is fun for me. If you'd like to try it too, Bob Newell maintains a pretty great [list of resources and links][3] that I found useful. Start there.
