I may have mentioned this before, but nothing beats [LibraryThing][1] for tracking your books. They've recently added a nifty [Javascript widget][2] for easily displaying select books from your library on, say, a weblog. I've added one showing 6 recently added books. They link to Amazon, so if you're one of those wierdos who hates Amazon for some obscure reason, don't click on &#8216;em.
