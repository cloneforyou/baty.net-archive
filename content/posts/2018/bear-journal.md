I've been giving [Bear](https://bear.app) another run as the place I take notes. I don't plan to use it as a journal, but if I do, Robert Jorgenson has created a nice set of bash scripts to automate the process.

[Bear Journal - Robert Jorgenson](https://gist.github.com/rjorgenson/def69e6bb01656328250d1dc0aa56d83)

There's one for daily and one for monthly entries. They can be easily tweaked to suit particular requirements.
