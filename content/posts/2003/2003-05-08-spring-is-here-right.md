Am I not supposed to feel great? All goofy and optimistic? Spring is here, love is in the air, tulips are blooming and all that. These things are supposed to make a fella feel pretty good, even if he refuses to admit it.

I'll just be here then. Waiting my turn. Thinking about what's next.

D'ya ever feel like doing something that would make everyone you've ever met say "What the fuck!?" I don't mean some chicken-shit terrorist nonsense, but something no one would have expected&#8230;

&#8230;something excruciatingly fun.

Any suggestions?
