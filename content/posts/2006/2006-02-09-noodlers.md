I've been using Noodler's ink in my fountain pen(s) for a while now and love it. One thing I didn't realize is that it "&#8230;contains a cellulose reactive dye that remains water soluble in the bottle and in your pens, but becomes permanent on paper when dry." This means that no-one will be washing \_my\_ checks. Wait, does anyone still use checks?
