The first time I used [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) it was still called "Phoenix".

I haven't used anything other than Safari in years, if you don't count repeated
failed attempts at using Chrome. I thought I'd see what's new with Firefox.
I've been running it for a couple of days and find it a pretty good experience
so far.

I'm not ready to make Firefox my default browser, but I've not given up yet either.
