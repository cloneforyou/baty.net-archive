From where I&#8217;m sitting, &#8220;the fundemental shape&#8221; is almost exactly the same. It&#8217;s at least a bit of a stretch to call it &#8220;completely changed.&#8221; Count me in the camp that believes the notch is an unwanted but necessary compromise and that Apple is simply not as ashamed of it as many people feel they should be. Developers are going to try camouflaging the notch because they believe (and I agree with them) that it&#8217;ll look better, whether Apple wants them to or not.

I don&#8217;t know about &#8220;courage&#8221;. Removing the headphone jack took more courage than this. The notch is nothing more than a visual inconvenience, where the missing jack is actually inconvienient.
