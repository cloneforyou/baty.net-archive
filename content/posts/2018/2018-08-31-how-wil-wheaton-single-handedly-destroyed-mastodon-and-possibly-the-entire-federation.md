Has there been a &#8220;Think Piece&#8221; written yet about [all this][1]? Odds are it&#8217;ll be called something click-baitey like the title of this post. I checked Medium but didn&#8217;t see one. Anyway, if you hear of one, please don&#8217;t let me know because I&#8217;d like very much to avoid reading it.
