Yesterday was to be a day of photographing. By 7:00am I had packed up 2 bags and was ready to roll. I sat for a few minutes thinking of what I might like to shoot. Then I sat for a few more minutes. The next thing I knew it was early evening and I had nothing.

The problem is that I've got things backwards. Instead of going out and randomly hunting for photo opportunities I should just know what I want to shoot and then go do that. Except it never works that way. I'm not one of those people who just can't keep up with their own ideas. I wish I were.

So late yesterday as I was cooking brats I decided to do a fun still life with my food. The result is below. Not especially original or interesting, but it was&nbsp;_something_. Maybe if I just keep doing something&#8211;anything&#8211;the interesting stuff will come.
