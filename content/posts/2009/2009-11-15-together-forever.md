Washington City Paper on Recycling and Trash: Together Forever:

> After the truck releases the Dumpster, the garbagemen get their hands on something that doesn't mix well with all that rotting garbage: the recycling. They roll up with bins holding newspaper, cardboard, bottles, and cans &#8212; all dutifully separated by employees at the bookstore and other businesses on this upper Connecticut Avenue strip. One by one, the men tip the contents of the recycling containers on top of the refuse &#8212; the bottles make a tinkling sound as the glass shatters against the truck bed.

> Then: They go back to collecting trash. The driver hits a switch and it's all smashed together before disappearing into the belly of the truck."

[Washington City Paper][1]

I know I'm supposed to recycle, but I usually don't. Neither do you, eventually.
