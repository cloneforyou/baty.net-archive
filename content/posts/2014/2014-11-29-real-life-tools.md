I try to keep tools everywhere, so they are always handy. In time, that plan always fails and I end up with six of the same size screwdriver in each location and I can't find a decent pair of pliers. Time to weed out the junk and get things tidy again. I upended a few drawers and neatly laid everything out. As expected, I have too many of some things and not enough of others.

Some of these tools are cheap and I hate cheap tools. Some are useless to me. I'll throw them away. On the other hand, some of them were given to me by my grandfather and may have been given to him by his, for all I know. These I'll keep, regardless of whether or not I'll ever need them. For example, what good is this tiny hammer?

Who knows, but it's cute and it belonged to my grandfather. Keep.

My problem is that I've laid everything out and now I don't know where to begin. Guess I'll leave everything spread out all over my kitchen and blog about it.
