I usually dislike when people cross post blog entries to every social media network they're on. With that in mind, I've decided to cross post blog entries to (nearly) every social media network I'm on.

For a while I maintained a separate Twitter account used only for links to things I've posted elsewhere. That would be useful if I had a ton of followers and posted stuff way more often than I do. I don't and I don't so I'm going to bundle it all together and see how that goes.

This way you'll never miss out on any of the quality contentÂ I publish! Or photos of my dogs.
