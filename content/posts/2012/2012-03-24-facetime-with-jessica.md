            Other than a quick test when I got my iPhone, I'd never used Facetime. But now that my daughter Jessica has an iPhone, I use it all the time.

            Jess recently vacationed in Florida and used Facetime to take me on virtual tours of wherever she was. Then she would ask me to "put the dogs on." The dogs, hearing her voice, would perk up and tilt their heads quizzically at the phone and Jess would laugh.

            Any doubts I had about the usefulness of Facetime have been dispelled.

            It's people that make technology so great.
