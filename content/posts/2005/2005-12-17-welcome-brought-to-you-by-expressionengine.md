[ExpressionEngine][1] was never a feasible blogging option for me. It's too expensive, especially with any number of free options available. Turns out they're now offering the core system free, so I thought I'd give it a whirl. EE seems to be much more than a blogging tool. It's also quite suited as a more general-purpose CMS. I'll by trying it for both.
