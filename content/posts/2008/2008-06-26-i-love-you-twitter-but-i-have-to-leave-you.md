That's it. I'm out. Twitter has lost most of its utility for me over the past several weeks. It's like feature whack-a-mole. One day replies are disabled, the next it's the "older" link. IM is pretty much always dead. I have been ramming Twitter down everyone's throat since before it had an "e" in the name, but I quit. Between the whack-a-mole game and the <span class="caps">FAIL</span> whale it's not worth it. 

In the meantime, [Friendfeed][1] is pretty much always working. And they actually _add_ features instead of the other way around. See you there.
