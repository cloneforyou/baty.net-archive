Blogs seem to need titles and taglines. This feels perfectly natural to me. What weblogs don't need are _bad_ titles and taglines.&nbsp; (Let's suppose for the sake of argument that mine isn't one of them.) Please, if you must blog(v.), refrain from any combination of the following&#8230;

</p> 

  * **Musings** &#8211; Musing implies thought, and let's be honest, most of us skip that part and get right to it.


  * **Random** &#8211; or any of its derivatives


  * **Stuff**


  * **Ramblings**


  * **Reflections**


  * No **l33t haX0r** nonsense. That's as bad as saying fo-shizzle &#8211; and even less cool.


  * **Radio Free**&#8230;whatever. 


  * No French or French-like words of any kind (e.g. L'dumbshit)


  * No **e x t r a s p a c e s** or **d.o.t.t.e.d w.o.r.d.s.** That was original once &#8211; in 1998.


  * **Rants** and/or **Raves** &#8211; We'll know if that's what you're doing. Then we'll stop reading you&#8230;. oh wait&#8230;.
</ul> 

Thank you for your consideration.
