I want to love Instagram. Really. It&#8217;s the least toxic of the big social networks and it&#8217;s mostly photography-centric. My problem with Instagram isn&#8217;t the content. My problem is with the feed. I don&#8217;t like it. In fact I don&#8217;t like it to the point of quitting the whole thing.

I get it, we&#8217;re beyond the halcyon days of reverse-chronological timelines on any significant social network, but good grief I can&#8217;t make heads or tails of what Instagram is feeding me (see [this article][1] for a few examples.)

They also seem to have ramped up the number of ads to every-half-dozen-posts-is-an-ad levels.

And their API is _still_ read-only so you can get stuff out but can&#8217;t put stuff in via any method other than their own tools (with [exceptions][2]).

I&#8217;m out.

I know, I know, this has happened before but I&#8217;m doing it (and writing it down) anyway. After all, it&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have any perfectly fine image sharing options. Let&#8217;s see&#8230;

  * [Micro.blog][3]
  * [jack.baty.net][4]
  * [VSCO][5]
  * [SmugMug][6]

You get the idea.

It&#8217;s hard to _not_ be where everyone else is, so who knows how long this will last, but it&#8217;s worth another attempt so here we go.
