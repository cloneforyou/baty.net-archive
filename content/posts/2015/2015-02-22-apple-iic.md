I found an Apple IIc and monitor in storage so I thought I'd see if it would fire up. It did.

<div id="attachment_4323" style="width: 490px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="/img/2015/02/IMG_0743.jpg"><img class="wp-image-4323 size-full" src="/img/2015/02/IMG_0743.jpg" alt="Apple IIc" width="480" height="640" srcset="/img/2015/02/IMG_0743.jpg 480w, /img/2015/02/IMG_0743-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 480px) 100vw, 480px" /></a>
  
  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    Apple IIc
  </p>
</div>

The IIc uses an internal 5 1/4 floppy and the only one I could find was "Writer Rabbit" so I popped it in, turned it on and everything, surprisingly, worked. I have no idea what to do with it now, but it seems a shame to put it back into a box in the basement.

Here's a quick (1:00-ish) video of Jessica playing the game.
