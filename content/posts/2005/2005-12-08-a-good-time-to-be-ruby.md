According to [O'Reilly][1], Python book sales are up 20% from the same period last year. That seems pretty good, until you learn that Ruby book sales from that same period are up 1552%. Now I'm no statistician, but by my calculation that works out to&#8230;let's see&#8230;carry the one&#8230;standard deviation&#8230;subtract the remainder&#8230;got it! It's a Shitload more books than last year.
