> For over 15 years, Japanese artist Tatsuo Horiuchi has rendered the subtle details of mountains, cherry blossoms, and dense forests with the most unlikely tool: Microsoft Excel. 

I&#8217;ve always thought that people use Microsoft Excel for more things than necessary and they should maybe use something else, but Tatsuo Horiuchi should keep doing exactly what he&#8217;s doing.
