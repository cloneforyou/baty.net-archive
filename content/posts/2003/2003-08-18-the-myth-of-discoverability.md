From [The Myth of Discoverability][1]&#8230;
  


> If, as a designer, I tried to weasel out of this, by giving everything equal attention in the design, I'd ensure only mediocrity. By treating everything equally, I'd force customers to make choices of prioritization, which generally, they're not so interested in doing. Most people are glad that the steering wheel in their automobile is easier to discover than the fuse box. They expect that whoever designed the automobile, or web site, is making good basic choices in their interest, so that they don't have to think about it.
