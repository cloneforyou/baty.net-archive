When it comes to photography, I'm a gearhead. I can't help it. I spend an inordinate amount of time at [photo.net][1] and [dpreview.com][2] reading about camera equipment. Here's a list of a few things I want right now&#8230;. 

* Canon 5D 

* Ricoh GR Digital 

* Leica M 35mm f2.0 (4th, tabbed version) 

* Voightlander 15mm 

* Another AlienBees strobe 

* A black muslin backdrop 

* Hasselblad 500c/m with 80mm Tessar 

* And so on&#8230; 

There are many things standing between me and a good photograph &#8211; none of them equipment.
