title: Permanent vs Useful
---

The ideal website is static and hosted on a simple service like Amazon S3 or a
cheap VPS. As long as someone keeps paying the bill, a static website will be
around forever. There's no need to worry about software upgrades or CMS
vulnerabilities. A static website is fast and permanent.

But for the editor(s), a static site isn't very useful.

This blog has run on just about every platform every created. I love when I
switch to a completely static build. It's just raw HTML files in a folder, what
could be better? Lot's could be better. 

I want to post from Ulysses or MarsEdit or whatever other tool comes along to
make the process more pleasant. I want to automatically post book reviews from [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1259384-jack-baty).
I want better integration with other services. I want to play with a wider range
of templates and widgets. I want to easily post from my iPad.

What I don't want is to deal with keeping Wordpress updated and running
smoothly. I don't want to worry about security issues. I don't want to worry
about making sure everything is backed up safely. I don't want to worry about
cache invalidation. I don't want to worry about keeping a VPS updated and secure.

I love playing with my site. Wordpress may not be simple or permanent, but it
makes everything else easier. For permanence, I can run httrack a few times a
year and mirror everything.
