Hardly anyone reads my little weblog, and yet I get a comment spam or two every day. I suspect it will get worse before it gets better, so after hearing about Jay Allen's [MT-Blacklist anti-spam plugin for Movable Type][1] I thought I'd try a little preventative medicine and install it.

Seems to be having a problem with SQLite, which is what I'm using for storage. I'm not the only one, am I? Anyway, Jay is still awake and working on a solution now.
