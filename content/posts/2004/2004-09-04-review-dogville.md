For much of the three grueling hours that is [Dogville][2] I wanted to rip director Lars von Trier's heart out.&nbsp; I enjoy a good misanthropic anti-everything that is American gloom-fest as much as the next guy, but _come on_, enough already.

But, it dared me to watch and I did. It was done cleverly (or at least interestingly) and on these levels it succeeded. Reluctantly, I recommend it.
