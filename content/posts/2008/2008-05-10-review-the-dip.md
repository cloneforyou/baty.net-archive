Quick review of Seth Godin's [The Dip][1].

The book is short and sweet, but could've been a blog post instead. I found myself thinking "Okay, I get it!" about a quarter of the way through. Here's my summary&#8230;

  1. Stuff gets harder, stick with it&#8230;
  2. &#8230;unless you shouldn't. Then Quit.

And all the "best in the world" stuff didn't really help. It's still worth the read.
