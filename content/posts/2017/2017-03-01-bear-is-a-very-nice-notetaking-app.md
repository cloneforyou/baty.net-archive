Recent versions of Apple’s Notes app have been pretty good. Still, I
frequently wish for more.

Enter, [Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/).

{{< figure src="/img/2016/feature-ui-mac@2x.jpg" >}}

Bear has many features that I found useful immediately. The big ones
are…

-   Markdown support
-   Linking directly to individual notes
-   Inter-note links
-   Decent export options

It’s only been a few days, but so far I don’t see any reason Bear
shouldn’t replace Apple Notes for me.
