After spending a few days with Ubuntu and Gnome (see [My Linux Experience Day Two][1]) I wanted a chance to finally try a &#8220;tiling&#8221; window manager. I&#8217;ve heard that they&#8217;re difficult at first but awesome once you&#8217;ve gotten the hang of it. Sounds right up my alley, so I installed [xmonad][2], rebooted, logged in, and&#8230;

Nothing. The login area faded away and the screen stayed exactly the same, but empty. I had expected a blank screen because that&#8217;s what xmonad starts with, so thought maybe this was it. I tried a few of the magic key combinations and again, nothing. Frustrated, I thought I&#8217;d look for alternatives to xmonad, just to get a feel for that type of window manager and see if I liked working that way.

[i3wm][3] seemed popular and well-liked and a decent alternative to xmonad so I decided to install it. While poking around I ran into [Manjaro i3 Community Edition][4]. What&#8217;s that? It&#8217;s a [Manjaro Linux][5] derivative that uses i3 and a sane configuration by default. I&#8217;d never even _heard_ of Manjaro Linux before. It&#8217;s based on Arch, which everyone told me was difficult, but it was highly ranked on [DistroWatch.com][6], so throwing caution to the wind, I wiped the ThinkPad and installed Manjaro i3.

I&#8217;m so glad I did. i3 is terrifying and I&#8217;m still swearing a lot, but I can see the future and it looks efficient, lightweight, keyboard-driven, and cool.

Another welcome side effect is that the trackpad is now behaving properly. Not sure what the deal with was with Ubuntu but this is way better.

I have a long way to go before being remotely efficient on Linux but I&#8217;m having so much fun that it&#8217;s totally worth it.
