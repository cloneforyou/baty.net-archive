Over at [diseased wits][1], Kevin seems to think that I have some sort of fetish involving scantily-clad women wearing cat ears. Whether or not it was true is no longer relevant, because even if I didn't have that particular fetish before, I do now.

"Rowr" is right. And Kev, no need to "dial up the sex factor." Trust me.
