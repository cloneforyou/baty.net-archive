It never ends. Now folks are spoofing the HTTP "referer" field so that links to their sites show up in log reports. Here's an example from my log report&#8230;

<img src="/images/blog/images/referrer-spam.jpg" height="255" width="442" border="1" align="middle" hspace="4" vspace="4" />

A fella could get tired of dealing with this after a while.
