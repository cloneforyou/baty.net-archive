I shipped my first [Ruby On Rails][1] app&#8212;an ecommerce website&#8212;in 2007. I had been writing PHP apps for a few years and working with Rails was a revelation. In fact, I was half finished writing that ecommerce site using PHP when I discovered Rails. I was so sure about Rails that I convinced the CEO to let me trash the PHP version and start over in Rails. It was worth it.

A few years later I drifted from writing code into more of a project management role. Of course I still work with developers every day, and have watched them chase newer, &#8220;better&#8221; technologies for years. They seem to have collectively decided that a full-on JavaScript stack (Node/React/Vue/Nuxt/etc) is where we should be. Is it though?

I&#8217;ve been itching to write some code lately and found my chance in a Rails app we&#8217;d been working on for years. I wanted a small change to the way something worked in the app, so I cracked my knuckles, ran `docker-compose` and friends, made the changes, submitted a PR and Bam! my work was in production. Rails worked much the same as it did when I was using it regularly. That was comforting, given the rapid change and deprecation I see everywhere else.

It felt really good. It also made me think about Rails again. It made me think about monoliths vs microservices. I wondered why I became infatuated with microservices along with everyone else a few years back. I think that maybe it&#8217;s because splitting apps into a bunch of services provides us the opportunity to play with something new without needing to toss the entire system. As fun as this can be, it probably isn&#8217;t the best approach for most teams.

I guess what I&#8217;m learning is that I kind of miss Rails. I lament that we were, collectively, so eager to find something new that we forgot how easy and productive it is to build stuff in Rails. I read about the [HEY Emal app stack][2] and was reminded how refreshing it would be to work with a stable, (relatively) simple stack like that.

Yes, I know there are a shitload of Rails apps still out there, and more being built all the time, but if you follow current development events, the mindshare has moved on. I wonder if it was a mistake.

This is just me wondering what I should do about my recent urge to build something. I could, [as I mentioned recently][3], go with something crazy like Clojure. Or, I could do what everyone else is doing and dive into JavaScript. Orâ€¦ I could put on my old, comfortable Ruby on Rails T-shirt and perhaps actually get something done.
