I've been crazy for Angelina Jolie for as long as I can remember. When she was married to Billy Bob, I couldn't imagine a more interesting place to want to have dinner than their house. (Not so much now with Brad, though.) What I liked, other than the obvious, is that she looked to be pretty much a no-bullshit type of gal. At first I was just a teeny bit worried when she seemed to have found a "cause." I generally can't stand celebrities with causes. Somehow I think this one is different. Anderson Cooper just got an unsolicited two-hour interview with her &#8211; for free. Now he's a believer too.

    I'm not sure what I expected before I met her, but to say I was impressed would be an understatement. She is smart, funny, self-deprecating, and intensely passionate about her children and her work on behalf of refugees.
