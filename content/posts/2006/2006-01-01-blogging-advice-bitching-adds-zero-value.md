title: 'Blogging advice: Bitching Adds Zero Value'

I have literally hundreds of feeds nestled somewhat uncomfortably within my RSS aggregator. In recent months it seems that many of the authors I track have done nothing but rant and complain and whine. Yesterday I decided to clean up my subscriptions and remove those that add no value. I removed nearly one third half of them. For those of you I've cut (yes, I know you don't care), here's some advice&#8230; Bitching Adds Zero Value. 

Here's a short list of things that I find actually add value to any given blog&#8230; 

* Create something new and show it to me. Photos, poems, ideas, I don't care which. 

* Teach me what you know about whatever it is you know. 

* Tell me what you like and don't like about something &#8211; anything, but don't bitch about it. There's a difference. 

* Point me to something you find interesting. 

* Tell me something about yourself now and then. 

To sum up, if you feel the urge to surround your next post with <rant> tags, just skip it. Maybe try <analysis> instead. Again, there's a difference.
