I knew going in that I would seriously dislike [Napoleon Dynamite][1]. All the kiddies at Sundance loved it and it starred what looked to be carrot top's half-brother. I sat through the first 5 minutes with a bemused look on my face. Shortly thereafter I laughed. Then I laughed again &#8211; almost continually for the remainder of the film. I'm not sure why, but I was hysterical. The movie really doesn't _try_ to be terribly funny, but when Kip ran over the tupperware bowl I almost wet myself. And yes, the dance sequence is nothing short of brilliant.

Thumbs up.
