[Jean MacDonald](https://micro.blog/macgenie) invited me to be on the [Micro Monday
podcast](http://monday.micro.blog/2019/01/06/episode-jack-baty.html) recently.
It was fun. We talked about blogging, of course, and at one point I said
something like "My goal in life is to have only one blog". We both got a chuckle
out of that, because we both knew I'm practically _riddled_ with blogs.

Not anymore.

Today, I burned down my WordPress blog at jack.baty.net and my Blot.im blog at
baty.blog. Normally, I leave things where they are and just stop posting to
them. This time, however, I moved the content to baty.net, set up domain
redirects, and _deleted_ them. This means I'm no longer tempated to post
elsewhere, nor do I have to think about "which blog should this go on?". Radical.

This leaves me with...

- [baty.blog](https://www.baty.blog/) - now known as "My blog"
- ~~[baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) - (formerly) known as "My blog"~~
- [micro.baty.net](https://micro.baty.net) - my micro.blog hosted microblog
- [rudimentarylathe.org](https://rudimentarylathe.org) - my wiki

How long will this last? `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

**Update 2019.01.26**: Not long, apparently. I missed using Blot so much that I've reverted to posting to [baty.blog](https://www.baty.blog).
