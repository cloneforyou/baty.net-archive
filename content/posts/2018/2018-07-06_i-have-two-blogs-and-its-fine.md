Over the years I've switched blogging platforms a dozen times or more. I enjoy
tinkering, and a personal blog is a great place for doing that.

The problem is that things frequently break in the transition. I have entire
swaths of images missing from 2012. Many of the older posts didn't convert well
and are filled with broken HTML. 

I've been waffling between a statically-rendered blog using
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and a blog running on WordPress. The last few years
it's been back and forth, back and forth. Static, WordPress, Static, WordPress.

To prevent further breakage, I've been running both. This blog,
[baty.net](https://www.baty.net/) runs Hugo and
[jack.baty.net](https://jack.baty.net) runs WordPress. I figured at some point
I'd get over my indecision and settle on one of them.

A static blog is fast, easy to host, portable, secure, and permanent. A
WordPress blog is flexible, full-featured, and so easy to use. Which to choose!?

At some point recently I stopped worrying about it. I just started posting to
whichever one I felt like at the moment. The unofficial intention was that
baty.net would be for longer, text-heavy posts and jack.baty.net would be for
"micro" posts, links, photos, etc. It's sort of gone that way, but the rules are
pretty loose and I haven't been over-thinking things the way I usually to. 

So right now I have two blogs and it's fine.
