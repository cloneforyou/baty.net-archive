I keep choosing "old" technology: Film cameras, 900mhz phones, things like that. The latest is my mail client. I'd been using [Mozilla's Thunderbird][1] since before it was really in any shape to be used daily. It's a great piece of software, and free, but a couple annoying little bugs have recently caused me to give up and go back to using [Mutt][2].

Mutt is a terminal based mail client for unix. Yep, I have to read my mail in a terminal window and use my keyboard to navigate and VI to compose messages. I can crank through mailing lists more quickly and compose messages faster this way.&nbsp; Plus it's almost completely configurable. Okay not almost, it is _completely_ configurable. God I'm a geek.
