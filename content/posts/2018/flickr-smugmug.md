[Me, writing about Flickr in 2004](https://www.baty.net/2004/flickr-the-feed-thickens/):

> So far, Flickr rocks. It’s still officially in beta, and things change/improve almost daily. The site is a great combination of easy to use and geek-friendly. The developers are focused on all the right things. There seems to be a core set of ideals that touch on things like standards-compliance, ease of use, extensibility, accessibility and other goodies.

[And again, a few months later](https://www.baty.net/2004/why-flickr-is-a-great-web-app/):

I've been a Flickr user since Caterina Fake still had time to [comment on my photos](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jbaty/744404/).

In a perfect world, Instagram would not exist. Flickr would still be the go-to
place for posting, organizing, and talking about photos. Flickr is better than
Instagram at everything around photo sharing. Everything except the active user
counts, I guess.

Yahoo botched such a great opportunity, it's maddening.

But, here we've been for nearly a decade. Last year, [Maciej
Cegłowski](http://www.idlewords.com) had a [great thought about Flickr](https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/12/15746916/pinboard-founder-maciej-ceglowski-interview-yahoo-delicious-fandom):

My comment then was "Seeing Flickr back in caring, competent hands would be the ideal outcome."

And out of seemingly nowhere, [SmugMug](https://smugmug.com) comes along and
[buys
Flickr](https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2018/04/20/smugmug-buys-flickr-verizon-oath/537377002/)[^nope].
I've been a SmugMug user for nearly as long as I've used Flickr. They've always
struck me as a company that cared about the user first, profit second. This is
why the announcement yesterday has me so giddy. SmugMug seems like our best chance
at the "caring, competent hands" I'd been hoping for. I believe Don MacAskill to
be smart, patient, and a photographer at heart.

I dare not guess where the SmugMug purchase of Flickr will lead, but I'm
unreasonably happy about it. Hopeful, even.

[^nope]: I'd link to the SmugMug announcement page but it's a horrible, overwrought, janky mess of a page. This is the only discouraging thing about the whole thing so far.
