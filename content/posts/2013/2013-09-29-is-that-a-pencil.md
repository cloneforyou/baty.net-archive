My daughter happened to be with me when I needed to write something in my notebook. I pulled out my handy [Midori Brass Bullet Pencil][1] and wrote my note. Looking up, satisfied, I saw her staring at my hand with her mouth hanging open.

"Is that a pencil?" she asked, as if she'd just seen one for the first time.

"Yes, of course, why?" I replied. 

She just shook her head dismissively and walked out of the room.
