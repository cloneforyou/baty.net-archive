My muscle memory is a mess. I spent years in Vim and then learned
Emacs. I started with Spacemacs so that I wouldn't be too distracted
by those nutty Emacs keybindings. It helped.

But I wanted to learn to configure Emacs on my own and so I powered
through the learning curve and rolled my own configuration. I actually
learned to (almost) enjoy the native bindings.

Trouble was at that point I was stuck between worlds. I'd hit Escape
when I didn't need to. I'd often confuse `j` with `Cntl-n` etc.
It was frustrating because I constantly had to think about bindings.
You're not supposed to always have to think about bindings.

The thing about using Vim bindings in Emacs is that it always feels a
little bolted on. As good as things like Doom Emacs and Spacemacs are
at abstracting it away, there are always sharp edges. My attempt to
configure Evil mode in my home-rolled configuration was a disaster.

While I believe that Vim's modal editing is generally more efficient
when editing text, it feels like a net loss overall. I'm going back to my
personal configuration and the native keybindings. Let's see if I can
get comfortable again.
