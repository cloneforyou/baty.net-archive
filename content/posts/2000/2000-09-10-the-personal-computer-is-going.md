The personal computer is going away. It's being replaced by a whole bunch (that's any number more than 5 or 6, in case you were wondering) of other types of devices. [Phones][1], [PDAs][2], [Clothing][3] and hell, even [furniture][4].
  


Don Norman uses the analogy of an electric motor. Way back before computers, electric motors were invented. They were so cool, that really bright [engineers][5] attached them to everything (the motors, not the engineers.) After a while, the motors got smaller, quiter and cheaper. Soon, the fact that a device contained an electric motor was not even considered. It was just a device.
  


That's what's happening with computers. It's gonna get cooler.
  


While this is happening, we'll need something to happen with our data. This [infoworld article][6] has a few thoughts. I think they're right.
