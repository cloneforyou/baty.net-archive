Ballmer says: "&#8230;The most common format of music on an iPod is &#8216;stolen'."

Oh I dunno, there are about 3,000 or so songs on my iPod and as far as I know, not a single one of them is stolen. In fact, I've purchased more music in the 2 months I've had my iPod than I did in the 2 previous years. So there.
