title: Missed photo - Z28
---

I spotted this Z28 while walking through a parking lot last night. Seemed like it would make a fun image so I snapped a photo of it with the little Ricoh.

What a miss. What I should have done was shoot centered and from a bit higher. Even better might have been to move slightly to the right, which would have made the classic pine tree air freshener hanging from the mirror more visible. I admit that I didn't even notice the air freshener at the time. I really need to actually _look_ at a scene before making a photo. Maybe then I wouldn't miss so many opportunities.

I miss photos because of my eyes not my gear.
