title: Using Render.com for static hosting
---

I like keeping my eye on the hosting/SaaS space, so I was interested to see what [Render](https://render.com) was like. To that end, I signed up and will be testing the process of hosting a static site (baty.net probably) using Render.

Static site hosting is free (with some limits). I connected my Github account and repo, created a new "Web Service" in Render and the whole thing was pulled, built, and deployed within minutes.

One nice thing is that Render assumes that submodules might be in use so it pulls those automatically during the build. I had a little trouble around submodules with other services.

If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll update my DNS and let Render do the work for a while. Currently, I'm using [Netlify](https://netlify.com) with no real complaints. I'm just curious about Render.
