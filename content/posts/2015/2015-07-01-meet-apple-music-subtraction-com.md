[Meet Apple Music + Subtraction.com][1]:

> The playlists include a whole bunch of stuff I can’t stand, along with a smattering of albums from acts that I’m okay with but not particularly passionate about

That's odd, because I've found the "For You" section to be almost eerily accurate. I can pretty much close my eyes, click anywhere, and hear a song I like.

I too am curious how much Apple Music uses my thousands of iTunes Match songs and purchase history to guide the recommendations. I almost hope they forget most of it or I'll be hearing Counting Crows or other bands I used to like but now, well, dislike.

Also the "bubbles" were fun and playful and worked like a charm.
