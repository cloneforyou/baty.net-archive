I love listening to Mozart. Always have. Even when I was (was?) a die-hard metal fan there was Eine Kleine Nachtmusik right there with Motley Crue in my tape case. (We had tape cases.) 

Mozart is like 18th century metal. Listen to it loud and just \*try\* not to bang your head a little. He even had the attitude. For example, he wrote a canon (K.231) called "Lick me in the ass." Seriously. 

Rock on Wolfgang.
