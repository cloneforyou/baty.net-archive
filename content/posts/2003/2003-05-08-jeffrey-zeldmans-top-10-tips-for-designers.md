Jeffrey Zeldman (A List Apart) offers these tips for web designers:

1. Think about the audience first.

2. Minimize bandwidth.

3. Give each site a personal voice and a real point of view. The audience will connect with that.

4. Do what's actually needed. Don't do things simply because you can.

5. Be entertaining. Inducing boredom is not a plan for growth.

6. In most cases, use Web standards and test your work at <http://validator.w3.org/> .

7. If you think you know all the answers, you're wrong.

8. If you're doing what you did last year, you're dead.

9. Test your site&#8212;not just on multiple browsers and platforms, but on people. Your interface is rarely as transparent as you think. But don't be a slave to test results, either. Trust your instincts. Balance them against test results. Rinse, lather, repeat.

10. Get half the fee up front.
