[The Bowery](https://www.onabags.com/store/messenger-bags/the-bowery.html?color=field-tan)
is my second bag from ONA. I wanted something small that I could carry
everywhere and the Bowery fits the bill. I carry a Leica M, the Fuji
X-Pro2, a couple rolls of film, spare battery, and a notebook. I like
everything about it. I'm told it looks a lot like a purse but that's
fine with me.

UPDATE July 26, 2019. I've had this bag for a while now, and the one thing I dislike is that it doesn't have a handle. Being forced to use the strap just to pick up the bag is a pain.
