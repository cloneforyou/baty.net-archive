Finally! My longed-for, dreamed-of and always-missed Gmail "Delete" button! Hurray for Google. Yes, I know there are Greasemonkey scripts that will add the same button in Firefox, but this is different. This is Google listening to what must've been nearly \*everyone\* begging for a simple delete button. The pallid basement dwellers who hang out on Digg are quick to point out that "sheesh dude, it's like a two-line bit of code, what's the big deal? No Digg." That misses the point entirely. Gmail has always been about "&#8230;so you'll never need to delete another message," and they meant it. And I hated it. 

Gmail has also always been about lightweight, usable, management of our email. Making us jump through hoops to delete messages (and we \*want\* to delete messages, no matter how much storage you give us) was in obvious and painful contrast to that goal. All better now. Thank you. Now about that "Delete All&#8230;" button.
