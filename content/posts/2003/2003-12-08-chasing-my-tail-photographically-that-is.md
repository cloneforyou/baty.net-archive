So what happened was&#8230;I just bought another camera.

This one is almost the exact opposite of the Digital Rebel I bought a couple months ago. This one is a 1972 [Canon Canonet QL17 G-III][1].&nbsp; About $50 on eBay. It's a film camera (obviously), it's a rangefinder, it's manually focused and it's really, really cool. No histogram, no LCD preview, no zoom, no multiple auto-focus zones. Just my eye and the shutter release and not much more.

I've got a long story about how and why I ended up with it, but the short of it is that I wanted to try photography without the technology. So now I'm walking around with a 30 year old camera around my neck and 2 rolls of Tri-X 400 in my pocket.
