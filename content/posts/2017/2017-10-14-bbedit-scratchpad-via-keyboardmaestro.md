I use [BBEdit's][1] Scratchpad window all day. For some reason I've never thought about making it easier to get to the window. While perusing BBEdit's Google Group, I spotted [this message by Fletcher][2], in which he provides a simple AppleScript for doing just that.

```
tell application "BBEdit" 
        activate 
        open scratchpad document 
        set the index of the window of scratchpad document to 1 
end tell 
```

In his post, Fletcher uses an Automator Service but I prefer [Keyboard Maestro][3]. I created a simple trigger in Keyboard Maestro that looks like this:

That's better.
