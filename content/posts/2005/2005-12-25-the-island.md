On the other hand, Michael Bay's [The Island](<http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/island/>) pretty much sucks. Mr Bay did The Rock, which was great. After that, it's been all downhill. Besides Michael Bay is a blowhard. \_Lots\_ of noise about not much. Scarlett Johansson is not-quite-too-pretty and very watchable, but skip this one.
