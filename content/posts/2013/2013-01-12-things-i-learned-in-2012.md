            Or perhaps, "I'll Certainly Learn Things in 2013 &#8211; Write them Down"

            Patrick Rhone recently posted a list of <a href="http://patrickrhone.com/2012/12/31/things-i-learned-in-2012/">things he learned in 2012</a>. While a fine list, it's an even better <em>idea</em>. I'm going to steal it.

            My version, at least so far, involves pen and paper. I'm thinking index cards. So, every time I learn something notable in 2013, I'll jot it down on a new card and toss it into what I hope will be a nice big pile. At the end of the year I'll package them into a cute little "Box &#8216;O Knowledge" and file them away for occasional perusal.

            Thanks for the idea, Patrick.
