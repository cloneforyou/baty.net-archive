Alice Cooper is blasting other rock stars who are planning to perform "benefits" in order to oust GW. Folks like Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and R.E.M are committing "&#8230;treason against Rock and Roll because Rock and Roll is the antithesis of politics."

I love this quote&#8230;

Alice is still cool, and suprisingly, relevant even today. On the other hand, the bands mentioned earlier, well, aren't.
