I was a little disappointed that the initial release of [Delicious Library][1] didn't come with some sort of HTML export feature. I'm sure they'll fix that soon, but until then, the [Delicious Exporter][2] will fit the bill well enough.

I've got most of my movies and a few of my books imported, [take a look at my library][3] if you like. It's, uh, delicious.
