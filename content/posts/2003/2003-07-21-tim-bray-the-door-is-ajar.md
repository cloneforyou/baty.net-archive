Tim Bray, once again [worth the read][1]&#8230;
  


> "People, on average and in the long term, aren&#194;'t stupid and aren&#194;'t patient and aren&#194;'t cowards. When there&#194;'s an obviously better way to get the job done, they go out and get it, and management can&#194;'t stop them, and Forrester and Gartner can&#194;'t stop them, and Accenture and EDS can&#194;'t stop them, and not even Microsoft can stop them."

He's talking about many things, but the relevant example is in the browser space&#8230;
  


> "Explorer, writes Peter-Paul Koch at evolt.org, cannot support today's technology, or even yesterday's, because of the limitations of its code engine. So it moves towards the position Netscape 4 once held: the most serious liability in Web design and a prospective loser."

He goes on to advocate a grass-roots effort to push Mozilla in front of enough of the right people. Count me in.
