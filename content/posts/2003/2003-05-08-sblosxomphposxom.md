Guess what, I've done it again. I kept waiting for [blosxom 1.2][1] to be
  

  
released and during that time ran into [PHPosxom][2].
  

  
PHPosxom (pronounced "possum") is a blosxom work-a-like written in PHP.
  

  
Since I love PHP so much I thought I'd give it a whirl. No need to
  

  
export the blosxom entries since it works exactly the same way. Also,
  

  
plug-ins are implemented, so you'll see the calender, category links and
  

  
next/prev links all implemented now.

Give me a week, I'll probably change my mind again, but hey, I love this
  

  
stuff.
