It seems that Comcast is [aggressively shaping BitTorrent traffic (torrentfreak.com)][1] and in some cases resetting seed connections. There goes my ratio! Now it'll take forever to download the latest episode of, er. latest Linux distro. 

A link in the above article points to a Whalesalad post on [tunnelling BT connections over SSH][2]. Should do the trick (althoug I haven't actually tried it yet.)
