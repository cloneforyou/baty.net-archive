For years I used Cocoatech&#x2019;s [Pathfinder][1] to compensate for the Mac Finder&#x2019;s shortcomings. I eventually stopped because it added more overhead than it was worth. Besides, Finder has gotten better recently. Still, sometimes I want just a little more oomph. 

![XtraFinder Preference Dialog][2]

Yesterday I discovered [XtraFinder][3]. I&#x2019;ve tried a number of Finder plugins but this one seems like a nice balance of power and convenience. It&#x2019;s valuable if only for the &#x201c;Automatically adjust width of Name column&#x201d; feature. Plus it adds things like Copy Path and Open in Terminal from any location. Good stuff.
