The next great video game "Revolution" from Nintendo is going to be called&#8230; are you ready&#8230;. "[Wii][1]." That's right, as in "We." Of course that's not how I see it. I see "Wee," as in "Wee Wee," as in, oh-my-God-that-name-sucks. How many teenage boys are going to buy something named after their grandmothers' euphemism for penis?
