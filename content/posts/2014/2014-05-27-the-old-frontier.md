In the late 90s the [fusionary.com][1] website was built and
  
rendered using Userland's [Frontier][2].

[This post from Brent
  
Simmons][3]
  
is a fascinating look back at what was happening during those heady times. I
  
loved Frontier and still miss using it.

Here's [what I wrote about it][4]
  
back in 1999.

Ah, the good old days.
