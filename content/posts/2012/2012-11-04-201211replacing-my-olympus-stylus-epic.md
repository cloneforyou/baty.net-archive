You will almost always find an Olympus Stylus Epic on or near my person. The unassuming little Stylus Epic is in my opinion the best compact film camera for carrying everywhere. It easily fits in my pocket, is weather resistant, has a very nice f/2.8 lens, a spot meter, and goes from pocket to photo about 25 times faster than my iPhone.

I've been carrying an Epic for about 10 years now, and the second one I've owned finally stopped working consistently. Occasionally it just doesn't fire, and there's a hairline crack somewhere which affects the top center of every frame. Not ideal, so I began looking to replace it.

Today on Craigslist, this showed up&#8230;

A nifty, like-new condition Stylus Epic Deluxe. In the box with all original paperwork, case, strap, etc. It's not black, but the champagne color is pretty nice.

I paid $10. How great is that! This is undoubtedly the best ten dollars I've ever spent on photography gear.
