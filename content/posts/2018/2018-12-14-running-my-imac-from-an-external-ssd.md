title: Running my iMac from an external SSD

My late-2014 27&#8243; iMac has had drive issues since shortly after I got it. It has a &#8220;fusion&#8221; drive, which is a managed combination of SSD and spinning hard disk.

At times, any disk access will hang the system for 10 to 20 seconds or longer. The machine quickly becomes unusable and I eventually restart, which seems to help for a while. Apple replaced it all in 2016 but the problem never really went away. I&#8217;d brought it to Apple a second time but they could not find anything wrong with it so I gave up.

I thought I&#8217;d try something. I bought a 1TB external SSD and installed a bootable system on it. I&#8217;m now running that (USB3.1) drive as my startup disk and things have been significantly faster. This is good.

The only problem so far is that sometimes when I reboot the Mac doesn&#8217;t find the external drive right away. The latest occurrence was this morning after a system update. I had to unplug the drive, restart, plug it back in and choose it as the startup disk, then restart again. This is a pain, but I no longer have to reboot often and as long as I can easily get things going again I&#8217;m happy with the trade.
