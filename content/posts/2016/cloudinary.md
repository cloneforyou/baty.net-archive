[Cloudinary](http://cloudinary.com) is pretty impressive. I've only used it in
small doses recently but so far it's been a very nice image
hosting/manipulation/delivery service. The free tier has been plenty for me.

I really like the "fetch" option which pulls images from a remote URL and then
transforms and caches them automatically. That way I can leave the "master"
images on my own server while utilizing Cloudinary for delivery.
