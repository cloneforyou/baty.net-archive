After a couple of great years working with [Jeremy][1], he's officially moved on. Seems as though a juicy position at a seemingly well-run startup in Boston was enough to lure him away from [us][2]. I'm sure he'll continue to kick ass. I'm just sorry I won't be there to see it. We'll miss you. We already do. 

All the best, Mr. Durham. All the best.
