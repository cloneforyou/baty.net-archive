As someone who struggles to maintain focus, I found Cal Newport's "[Deep Work](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25744928-deep-work)" to be
instructive and useful.

The book was part theory, part practical guide to keeping distractions
and unnecessary work at bay. Much of it was self-evident: don't tweet so
much, but it was good hearing ideas surrounding why. The book is well
researched, but much of the evidence backing Newport's ideas are
collections of anecdotes. I love anecdotes, but collecting anecdotes is
not the same as science.

I spent the past work week applying some of what I learned, and the
early results are promising. Well-worth the read.
