I've been using 1Password for years without too many issues. It's a nicely designed and implemented app with a long history. I really had no reason to look elsewhere.

However, there's been a lot of noise lately about them [taking $200 million in VC money](https://techcrunch.com/2019/11/14/fourteen-years-after-launching-1password-takes-first-funding-a-200m-series-a/). I'm not that concerned. They've grown and want to grow faster, so fine. It did, however, make me take a quick look at the alternatives, just in case.

A number of people, especially those concerned with privacy, recommend [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com) as an alternative to 1Password. I've signed up and imported my data from 1Password. Let's see how it goes.

Bitwarden's Premium license is $10/year. There's also a "Family" plan for $1.00/month for up to 5 people. That's pretty cheap.

But how well does it work? Well, after only a couple of days of testing I've decided it's worth a decent attempt to make the switch to Bitwarden. It's reasonably polished, open source, audited by 3rd parties, and inexpensive. It feels just a tiny bit nerdy, which, in my experience, means that when features are added they're more likely to address actual user needs.

There's an iOS app that can be configured as a password store, just like 1Password.

If I choose, I could run my own copy of the server. I may in fact do this once things have gotten burned in a bit and I haven't found any deal-stoppers.

It's been pretty seamless so far. I'll report back if it works out...or doesn't.

One thing I find interesting is that 1Password has nearly 200 employees, and as far as I can tell, Bitwarden is developed mostly by one guy. That's a huge difference in resources for things that seem, at least on the surface, to be quite similar.
