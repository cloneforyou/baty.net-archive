Another Java guy, [David Geary][1] is loving Rails and suspects that [Rails has reached a tipping point][2]. He explains this in the context of Malcom Gladwell's book, [The Tipping Point][3]. This quote stand out&#8230;

I think that of his three factors, "stickiness" is the standout. Almost everyone who uses Rails for more than an hour or two wants to stay up all night and rewrite every web app they've ever written. I should know, I've already started doing just that.
