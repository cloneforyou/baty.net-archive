I get to watch Cecil for the next couple of days. He’s such a cute dog.

I’m trying Diafine again, because I like the idea of shooting Tri-X at
1250 and not worrying about temperature, accurate timing, etc. This roll
ended up with some spotty areas, so I’m not sure what happened yet. I’ll
try again.
