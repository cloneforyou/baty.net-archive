Sometimes I wonder how I end up with such an odd assortment of movies in my Netflix queue. Case in point: [Dracula: Pages from a Virgin's Diary][1].

Check this, a (black and white with orchestral accompaniment) silent movie, adapted from a ballet adapted from the Bram Stoker novel.

The filmaker uses all sorts of visual hoo-ha to play with the eyes: out of focus bits, tinting, odd wipes, boosted contrast, etc. At first it felt a tad gimmicky, but after a bit I found myself completely absorbed.

Give it a try. At the very least it will be unlike anything else you see this year.
