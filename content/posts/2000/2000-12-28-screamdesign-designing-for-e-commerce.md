[ScreamDesign – Designing for e-commerce][1]

Not sure I get it. First he says, "The most important thing a design team can do is really be clear about what you&#194;&#185;re selling. Avoid euphemisms at all costs: if people don't understand what a product is they're not going to buy it."

Then he describes their product categories, which are "Taste", "Savor" and "Live". Seems to be a contradiction there somewhere.
