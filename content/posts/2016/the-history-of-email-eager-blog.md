A fun history of one of the most ubiquitous communication mechanisms ever.

I love email. It's easy, lightweight, and encapsulates a universal-ness that has
never been surpassed. Having all that means I can live with the parts that suck
(e.g. spam and encryption). It's fun and popular to hate on email, but I have
years of messages living in a directory of simple text files, forever accessible
and all mine.
