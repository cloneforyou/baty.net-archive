One down side of my love for tools and toys is that I can't use them all at once. In fact, some don't get used for weeks or months at a time and that's a shame.

My paper notebooks and fine pens have languished while I've been amusing myself with [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/).

My favorite typewriter hasn't annoyed my family with it's slapping sounds for months.

Some wonderful film cameras just sit on a shelf.

I suppose this is normal, but I often feel guilt around having things and not using them. Or not using them _enough_, I guess.

A positive side effect of noticing this neglect is that now I'm determined to use all of these things...today!
