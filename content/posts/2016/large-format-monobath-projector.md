{{< figure src="/img/photos/2016_lf-002_projector-processed.jpg" title="8mm Film Projector (2015). Crown Graphic. HP5+ in R3 Monobath" >}}


I'm still testing the new
[Monobath developer](http://www.baty.net/2015/first-attempt-using-r3-monobath/)
from New55. My
[first attempt](http://www.baty.net/2015/first-attempt-using-r3-monobath/)
didn't go terribly well but this one looks much better. The projector was
shot on HP5+ using a Crown Graphic. Exposure was f/5.6 for 1/10th second.

I would love to continue using the Monobath developer, as it's so easy to use.
