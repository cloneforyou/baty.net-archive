Last Saturday evening shortly after midnight I was mindlessly browsing around when I ran across the [Kubrick template][1] for [WordPress][2]. I liked it so much I decided to use it for my own little &#8216;blog. At the same time I figured I'd update WordPress to the latest nightly build. 3 hours later I was realizing what a terrifically bad idea that was. Repeat after me: never, _ever_ change more than one thing at a time! Anyhoo, I ended up finally getting everything working and all was well. Just one more little tweak and&#8230; wait a minute!&#8230; the default WordPress template looks suspiciously like the one I'd just spent all night working on. Then, a few minutes later, I read this on the Presentation page of the WordPress admin:

> 
> 
> "The default WordPress theme based on the famous Kubrick."

Great, not only did I just waste an entire evening farting around with a template that I already _had_, but over the next few weeks **everyone's** weblog is going to look exactly like mine. Time to focus on that blue bit up there I suppose.
