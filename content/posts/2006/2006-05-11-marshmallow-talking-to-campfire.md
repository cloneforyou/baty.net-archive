[Campfire][1] is a wonderful app. Just the right balance of immediacy and "whenever I need it." And now, with the nifty [Marshmallow][2] library, it's also a bot-driven notification tool. We've got all of our Subversion commit messages and Capistrano deployment notifications posting to a Campfire room. With the right hooks, this could be what I wanted Jabber to be several years ago.
