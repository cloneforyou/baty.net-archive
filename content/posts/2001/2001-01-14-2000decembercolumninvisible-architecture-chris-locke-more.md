[2000:December:Column:Invisible Architecture][1]

> Companies don&#194;'t have values or voices, only people do. Fortunately, your company has lots of people. How many stories does your building have? Before you can answer, you must understand what a story truly is. To do that, you first have to find your own. If you can&#194;'t, you&#194;'ve got nothing to say worth listening to. And your audience is listening. For a heartbeat.
