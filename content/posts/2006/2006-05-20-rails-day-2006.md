[Rails Day 2006](<http://www.railsday2006.com>) is officially on. June 17th. Get yourself a team, registration will open soon. We at [Fusionary Media](<http://fusionary.com>) are participating as a sponsor by providing the web site design and hosting. Our own [Dan](<http://tobolic.com>), [Jay](<http://www.accutask.net/>) and [Rex](<http://www.rexrainey.com/>) have done a fantastic job putting the site together. And of course, it's all due to Mr. Bryan Helmkamp's effort putting things together. See you on June 17th.
