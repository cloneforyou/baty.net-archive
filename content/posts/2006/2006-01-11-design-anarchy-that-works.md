Jesse James Garrett: [MySpace: Design Anarchy that Works](<http://www.businessweek.com/innovate/content/dec2005/id20051230_570094.htm>) 

> It came late to the market&#8212;so late, in fact, that by the time it launched, people were already declaring the product category dead. It offered no new technology&#8212;virtually every feature of the site was an imitation of something someone else had already done. It looked amateurish, lacking even the most basic level of visual consistency and appeal, never mind the high-gloss polish of its venture-backed competitors.
