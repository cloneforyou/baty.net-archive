I can get a little crabby. I don't mean to, but it sometimes just happens. Today was the kind of a day that I thought was destined to go on forever, yet not move an inch. _That_ makes me crabby. Then, Bryan sent me "this, from JibJab":http://www.jibjab.com/starring_you/receipt/417339.

All better

(I tried embedding the video, but it crashed both Safari and Firefox &#8211; hard. See, now I'm crabby again, dammit!)
