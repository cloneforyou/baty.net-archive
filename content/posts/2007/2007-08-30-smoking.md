I used to smoke. For about 10 years I averaged 2 packs of non-filtered Lucky Strikes every day. I was damn good at it; Chicks dug me.

That photo was taken in 1984 and is one of the rare shots of me as a smoker. I quit about 10 years ago. Times sure have changed. Tonight I went out for dinner at a local restaurant and spent most of my time complaining about the guys smoking at the table next to us. It was messing with my food and making my eyes sting! 

Not smoking is better than smoking. I know that. But sometime over the past 10 years the chicks stopped digging me as much and I've become kinduva wuss. I sometimes wonder if smoking (or not) had anything to do with it.
