[Mandy Michael][1]:

> The worst part about pushing the “know everything” mentality is that we end up creating an industry full of professionals suffering from burnout and mental illness. We have people speaking at conferences about wellbeing, imposter syndrome and full stack anxiety, yet despite that, we perpetuate this idea that people have to know everything and be amazing at it.

I&#8217;d be fine if the majority of the web was made up of _only_ HTML and CSS but I&#8217;m never going to have my way. She&#8217;s right that we need to stop devaluing CSS and HTML.
