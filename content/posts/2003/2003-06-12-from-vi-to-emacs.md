title: From VI to Emacs
url: /2003/from-vi-to-emacs/
---

I use plain old vi or [Vim][1] pretty
  

  
regularly these days and in doing so have gotten through one of most painful and
  

  
frustrating learning curves ever. I actually prefer it to things like
  

  
jEdit and Homesite for a lot of editing tasks. Trouble is, I can't
  

  
shake the urge to learn [Emacs][2].

Of course now that I'm actually used to
  

  
type-beep-curse-type-curse-hit-escape editing, Emacs feels horrible.
  

  
All that control-meta key contortionism and C-x letter letter M-x
  

  
letter nonsense makes me want to shout even more obscenities than when
  

  
using vi.

In spite of all that, I would really love to get used to a non-modal
  

  
editor that is infinitely customizable, free and, from what I hear, very
  

  
powerful.

So I'm going through the tutorial just to see how much pain I can
  

  
withstand. Maybe I'll write a couple of my next posts with it. If you
  

  
don't hear from me for a few days, you'll know why.
