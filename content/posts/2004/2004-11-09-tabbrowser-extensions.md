Firefox tabbed browsing is great, but only until you've installed the [Tabbrowser Extension][1]. You'll then have&#8230;

</p> 

  * A close box on every tab, as it should be (must be enabled)


  * The ever-popular "Undo Close Tab" item.


  * Drag and drop tabs to re-order them.


  * When closing a tab, the previously selected tab is then selected (must be enabled)
</ul> 

And a ton more. I'm not sure why this extension isn't listed on the main Firefox site, but it works lovely and once you've installed it you'll never want to live without it.
