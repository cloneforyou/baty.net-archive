Mozilla Firebird 0.6.1 really is a fabulous browser. I installed it the minute it was released, as version 0.6 still had the god-awful autocomplete bug. Haven't experienced even the slightest hiccup since. I was browsing from someone else's machine earlier using IE 6 and realized how good Firebird really is. No popups, tabs, lightweight and clean interface and quick access to everything useful in a browser. Add to that a few (optional) [extensions][1] and life is good. It's not a huge download, so why not just [go get it now][2] and see for yourself.
