A few days ago I read about the quantum computing experiment which basically claimed to have used a "quantum based optical computer" to solve a problem &#8211; without even turning it on! Okay, that's just crazy talk. I read the [original article][1] twice. I understood none of it. Today, a [3QD post][2] has culled a number of resources helping to explain the whole thing, including [this wonderful explanation][3]. I still don't get it, but I don't get it less than before, which I think is good.
