Studio photography has never really interested me. I take mostly "situational" photographs which require no setup or planning or, frankly, skill. Recently, however, with my continuing move to medium and now large formats, adding a little control to the process seems like a good idea.

As a baby step, I set up a "studio" in my garage. It consists of a backdrop, one strobe, and a small window.</p>

Once I get the 4&#215;5 camera rolling, I plan to try a few portraits here. Nothing fancy, obviously, but it's a start. Here's a test shot of my dad. I've got work to do, but it's fun.
