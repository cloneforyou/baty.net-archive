Steven Soderbergh tries bringing something new to every film he's involved with. With Solaris, he brings a love story to science fiction with a beatifully shot mind game that was better than the original (1972 by Andrei Tarkovsky). Ambiguous, moody and not for everyone, but interesting and very much worth the effort.
