Sorry to bother y'all again, but I'd appreciate it if you would stop listing trackbacks at the end of every blog post. In many cases, the most interesting parts a post are found in the comments, but wading through the trackbacks is as annoying, and usually less useful, as wading through a half-dozen Google ads. On this site it would go something like this&#8230;

I say "foo" in a post and it is well-written and terribly interesting&#8230;

Then come the trackbacks&#8230;.

Hey, Jack said "Foo" (link to someone's site here)&#8230;

Guess what, Jack said "foo" again (link to another someone's site here)&#8230;

"Foo" seems popular, as Jack mentions in his weblog (yet another link here)&#8230;

And so on for about 3 screens. Any valuable commentary regarding a given post will show up in the "sphere" on its own. And besides, you don't need to show me links to your article. Since I just read it, I've likely **already found** it. There are, I suppose, arguments that these links are helpful in some way, but usually it's simply the circle-jerk vanity fest we bloggers love so much.
