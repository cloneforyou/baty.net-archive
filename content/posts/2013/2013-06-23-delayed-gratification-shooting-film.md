            Many people feel they <em>need</em> to see their photos immediately after taking them. Digital photography solves that problem nicely for those people. Personally, I don't understand that need and I prefer the delay that shooting film introduces into the process.

            The above photo was taken this past winter while driving during a snowstorm. The gentleman in the photo wasn't phased a bit by the fact that he was waiting at a red light on his bike while snow began to pile up around him. He was probably tweeting about it.Â

            I just had the roll processed today, and was happy to discover images taken during an entirely different season. The pleasure of the surprise makes the slower process of shooting film worth the wait.
