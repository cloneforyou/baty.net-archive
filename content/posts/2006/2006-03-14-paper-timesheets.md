Tracking time on projects is hard. No, that's not true, it's easy to do, it's hard to do consistently and accurately. Holding to my never-wavering belief that software can solve all of life's problems, I've tried 6 or 8 time tracking apps. Each of them failed in its own way. 

So I've gone back to the most reliable and easy to use time tracking tool available &#8211; paper. I track my time by 15 minute intervals, so the form I use looks like this&#8230;

I just write the project's name on the left and fill in each 15 minute block as I think of it. End of day, just add it up. It works pretty well for me. If you want to try it yourself, [download timesheet.pdf][2] and give it a whirl.
