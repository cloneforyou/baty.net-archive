title: Comments are out, Friendfeed is in
url: /2008/comments-are-out-friendfeed-is-in/

I've removed comments from this here blog. Not because of trolls. I get very few comments anyway so abuse hasn't been a problem. Not because of spam. Disqus did a good job of preventing that. Then why? Because on the off chance I write anything interesting enough to comment on, most of the comments will likely end up on [Friendfeed][1] anyway, so why not just let them happen there instead? Friendfeed hasn't fragmented the conversation, it's stolen them completely. I'm cool with that.
