[Lifehacker Code: Todo.txt CLI Manages Your Tasks from the Command Line][1]: "Dozens of fancy point-and-click task managers promise to organize your to-do list, but so often power users find that nothing outdoes that trusty old classic: the todo.txt file."

I would normally be all over this. I love Vi, love text files, and so on. What I don't want is to fart around with yet another task management toy, so I've got to pass. Every day in every way I am getting better and better.

Y'all have fun with it, though.
