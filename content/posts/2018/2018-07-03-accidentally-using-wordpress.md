For the last week or so I&#8217;ve been posting to jack.baty.net, a WordPress-managed blog. This wasn&#8217;t intentional. I&#8217;m _supposed_ to be putting everything on baty.net, which is statically rendered (by Hugo).

I guess I haven&#8217;t felt like &#8220;writing a blog post&#8221;. Instead I felt like posting stuff. WordPress makes everything so easy. Maybe too easy.

I keep threatening to consolidate everything on baty.net but I&#8217;m realizing it may never happen. I&#8217;ve got baty.net for when I&#8217;m slow and serious, and this blog for when I just want to post something.
