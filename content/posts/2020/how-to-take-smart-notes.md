+++

[Jethro Kuan](https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/how%5Fto%5Ftake%5Fsmart%5Fnotes%5Forg/):

> This is the workflow I use. Here I explain what I think note-taking should be, and why it should be this way. I implore you (especially users of Org-roam) to read this through.

Jethro describes how he takes notes in Org mode and specifically how he uses
[org-roam](https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-roam).

I am still deciding between [Roam](https://roamresearch.org) and org-roam so this was helpful. And remember,
_it's the backlinks!_
