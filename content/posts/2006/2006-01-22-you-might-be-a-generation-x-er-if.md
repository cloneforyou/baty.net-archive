A great list of memory-jolting things from "back in the day." A couple of favorites&#8230; 

* Your first VCR cost $1,000. 

* You watched HR Puffenstuff as a child, but now that you're older, you really understand that it would have been much better had you known about drugs at the time. 

* Schoolhouse Rock played a HUGE part in how you actually learned the English language.
