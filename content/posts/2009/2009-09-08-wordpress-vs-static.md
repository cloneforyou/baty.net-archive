He's right, running only static HTML files is pretty secure. What I think he's wrong about is that his "answer is much simpler." The statement that keeping WordPress up to date "&#8230;is the same as saying, devote half your life to learning and understanding WordPress administration" is not really valid these days. One click while logged into the WordPress control panel, and Poof! you're up to date.

On the other hand, his "simpler" solution required a [follow up post](http://idlewords.com/2009/09/using\_wordpress\_to\_generate\_flat_files.htm) containing at least 7 steps requiring much geekery and with the hope that&#8230;

No normal person with a WordPress blog is going to go anywhere near that. Granted, if my livelihood depended upon my weblog, I would make the effort, and maybe that's the intended audience for his post. Most of us should probably just upgrade to 2.8.4 the hard way once, then pop in regularly and click the upgrade link if it's there. Hmmm, maybe I could create a cron job using my SSH key and&#8230; oh nevermind.
