[<img class=" alignright " style="margin: 5px;" src="/img/2014/11/desk1.png" alt="" width="304" height="260" />][1][Desk][1] is a nice new desktop blogging app, and I love desktop blogging apps so I [bought it][2]. I’ve been a [MarsEdit][3] user for years and I love it, but that doesn’t mean I’m never going to try something new. I’ve recently [tested Blogo][4], another newcomer, but it never stuck for some reason. [Blogo][5] feels like not much more than a pretty version of MarsEdit and that hasn’t been reason enough to switch.

Desk is more like Byword or Writer but specifically suited to blogging. I like it.
