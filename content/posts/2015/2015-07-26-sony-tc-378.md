You just knew I was going to end up with a reel-to-reel deck some day. Or as I like to call it, reel-to-_real_.

Many of the [GRAMC][1]{.} films include a separate audio track on 1/4-inch magnetic tape. I had no way to play the audio so I bought the above Sony TC-378 from aÂ local record store. It's probably overkill but it's pretty cool.

The TC-378 was manufactured in 1976. From what I gather it's a pretty decent unit with many spare parts still available if it needs service.
