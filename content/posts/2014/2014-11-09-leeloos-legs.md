A couple months ago Leeloo came in from outdoors and was limping. She would put almost no weight on her right rear leg. I gave it a couple of days but things didn’t improve so I took her in to have the leg looked at. The vet took X-rays and determined that her hips were fine so she suspected a torn ACL (technically the cranial cruciate ligament).

My bank account was still recovering from having my other dog Katie’s eye removed so I decided to hold off on any surgery for Leeloo. Then a couple weeks later I noticed she also wasn’t putting weight on her _left_ rear leg. She could barely get up to go outside.

Back to the doctor we went and she was officially diagnosed with a torn cranial cruciate ligament in _both_ legs. I read everything I could find about knee treatment for dogs, including non-surgical remedies, and decided on the standard replacement technique using a nylon substitute. Cost for the procedure: $1700 per leg.

Leeloo underwent surgery 2 days ago. It went well and she’s home recovering. She’s uncomfortable and a little confused. I have to support her back end with a sling whenever she needs to move. The recovery process is going to be challenging will take a full 6 months, but she should regain full use of both legs.

In case you were wondering, yes, Leeloo was named after Milla Jovovich's badass character in [The Fifth Element][1].
