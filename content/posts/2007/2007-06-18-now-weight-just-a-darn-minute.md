I weighed 193.4 pounds at 9:00am this morning. I know this because I have a scale in my office. A pretty good one I think, and today, it read 193.4. That of course can't be right, because last Thursday it said 190.2 and I've run at least a mile every day since then. I got back on the treadmill because if you run every day you'll lose weight, right? A mile isn't very far, but dammit it's \*something\*! As a matter of fact it's almost exactly one mile further than I usually run. And I've had no fast food at all, so I'm confused. I'm sure tomorrow it will be back down to around 185 or something. I'll let you know.
