Two words: Angelina Jolie. Finally, she's back as Fox; exactly the type of too-hot bad-ass she was born to play. As for the rest of [Wanted][1], just sit back, put your mind on hold and prepare for gorgeous, non-stop over-the-top action from start to finish. And for the ladies, McAvoy is almost as ripped as Jolie. This movie is why they coined the phrase "Summer blockbuster."

I still don't get the whole bullet-bending thing, but I don't think that even matters. Recommended.
