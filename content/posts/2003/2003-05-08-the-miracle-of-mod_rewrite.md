Moved a bunch of stuff around today, before I saw that some folks (including Robert Daeley, author of [PHPosxom][1]) had linked to my post about PHPetal earlier. The permalink for the original post was <https://www.jackbaty.com/index.php?entry=/geek/untitled.txt>. In the meantime I renamed the /geek directory to /dev. This of course broke the links. I'm learning the joys of mod_rewrite and this little bit fixed things right up.

<pre>RewriteCond %{QUERY_STRING} ^entry=/geek/untitled.txt
RewriteRule ^(.*)$
/index.php?entry=/dev/untitled.txt [R]
</pre>

Cool!
