I usually ignore those all-too-cute forwards that I regularly get , but the following hit so close to home that I thought I'd share. Apologies in advance if you've seen it already&#8230;.

I decide to wash my car. As I start toward to the
  

  
garage, I notice that there is mail on the hall table.
  

  
I decide to go through the mail before I wash the car.

I lay my car keys down on the table, put the junk mail
  

  
in the trash can under the table, and notice that the
  

  
trash can is full.

So, I decide to put the bills back on the table and
  

  
take out the trash first, but then I think that since
  

  
I'm going to be near the mailbox when I take out the
  

  
trash anyway, I may as well pay the bills first.

I take my checkbook off the table and see that there
  

  
is only one check left. My extra checks are in my desk
  

  
in the study, so I go to my desk where I find the can
  

  
of Coke that I had been drinking.

I'm going to look for my checks, but first I need to
  

  
push the Coke aside so that I don't accidentally knock
  

  
it over.

I see that the Coke is getting warm, and I decide I
  

  
should put it in the refrigerator to keep it cold.

As I head toward the kitchen with the Coke, a vase of
  

  
flowers on the counter catches my eye&#8212;they need to be
  

  
watered.

I set the Coke down on the counter and I discover my
  

  
reading glasses that I've been searching for all
  

  
morning.

I decide I'd better put them back on my desk, but
  

  
first I'm going to water the flowers.

I set the glasses back down on the counter, fill a
  

  
container with water, and suddenly I spot the TV
  

  
remote. Someone left it on the kitchen table.

I realize that tonight, when we go to watch TV, we
  

  
will be looking for the remote, but nobody will
  

  
remember that it's on the kitchen table, so I decide
  

  
to put it back in the den where it belongs, but first
  

  
I'll water the flowers.

I splash some water on the flowers, but most of it
  

  
spills on the floor. So, I set the remote back down on
  

  
the table, get some towels and wipe up the spill.

Then I head down the hall trying to remember what I
  

  
was planning to do.

At the end of the day; the car isn't washed, the bills
  

  
aren't paid, there is a warm can of Coke sitting on
  

  
the counter, the flowers aren't watered, there is
  

  
still only one check in my checkbook, I can't find the
  

  
remote, I can't find my glasses, and I don't remember
  

  
what I did with the car keys.

Then, when I try to figure out why nothing got done
  

  
today, I'm really baffled because I know I was busy
  

  
all day long and I'm really tired.
