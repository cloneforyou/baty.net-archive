I&#8217;m beginning to feel like cross-posting everywhere is rude to readers in many cases. Who wants to see the same content everywhere they turn? My followers on Twitter and Facebook don&#8217;t overlap much, so most people see my stuff only once.

On the other hand, the _type_ of content that is useful differs on each platform, so sending everything everywhere may not be wanted.

Plus, does everything that comes out of my head really need to be seen by everyone, automatically? I don&#8217;t think so. I should probably just get over myself and hand-post only the things I think might be welcome or that I&#8217;m particularly fond of, in a format suitable to each platform.
