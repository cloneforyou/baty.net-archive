I admit it. I'm guilty. Yes, I sometimes toss some CSS inline just so I know where to find it later. Otherwise, I've got to reverse-engineer the entire document structure and a 4000 line stylesheet just to find out why the hell that font isn't blue like I damn sure told it to be!

Simon Willison is [asking for some guidance][1] and I hope he gets enough of it to help little ol' me get some work done.
