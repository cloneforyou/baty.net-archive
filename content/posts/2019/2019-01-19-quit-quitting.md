title: Now that I've deleted [Social Network]...

Talking about quitting things is sapping my energy.

There are of course valid reasons to stop using a service, platform,
or company. I’ve deleted Facebook and LinkedIn and have
stopped posting to Instagram and Twitter for many of these same reasons.

While I wouldn’t ask anyone to _not_ tell people they’ve moved on from
a social network[^guilty], I would like to see less about why they’ve
quit and more about what they will do instead.

Most articles I’ve read about quitting are 90% rationale and 10% about
what’s next. I’d prefer to see that reversed. Something like...

> So, now that I’ve deleted Facebook...  
>   
> [2,000 words about what I’m doing instead]

Make it about _starting something_ rather than about quitting. I think that would be better.
