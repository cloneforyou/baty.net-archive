My friend Dylan was picking the movies and music that he thought defined him. I suggested it was impossible to do that, but he shot back that it was simple, and quickly defined "Jack-ness" for me, like so&#8230; 

  * Errol Morris


  * Woody Allen


  * Home Movies


  * Freeway


  * A Boy and His Dog


  * Iron Maiden


  * and of course Gone in 60 Seconds
