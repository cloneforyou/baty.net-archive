I haven't watched much CNN or other major network news since they started putting **way** too much data on the screen. I've maintained that if you think you're getting more news faster that way, you're wrong. Now there seems to be data to back that up. From a recent [Kansas State University study][1]

"Our conclusion has been that if you want people to understand the news better, then get that stuff off the screen&#8230;The outcome of all of the experiments was that people were splitting their attention into too many parts to understand any of the content"
