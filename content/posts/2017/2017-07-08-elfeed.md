My ongoing [efforts](https://baty.net/2016/the-problems-i-have-with-org-mode-and-emacs/) to stop using Emacs [continue](https://baty.net/2017/i-had-emacs-open-and-it-just-happened/) to [fail](https://baty.net/2017/sticking-with-org-mode/). 

Moving away from Emacs becomes more difficult every time I adopt a new Emacs module, replacing yet another tool or process. This time, I've started using Emacs for reading RSS feeds. I'm trying [Elfeed](https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed) as my feed reader. It looks like this...

The list of feeds is maintained as an Org Mode file using [elfeed-org](https://github.com/remyhonig/elfeed-org). I have the feed list and elfeed's database in Dropbox so everything syncs nicely.

Elfeed is fast, easy way to burn through a long list of feeds using familiar keybindings in a familiar environment. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em, I guess.
