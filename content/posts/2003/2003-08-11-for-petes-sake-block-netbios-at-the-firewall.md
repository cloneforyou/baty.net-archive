Yet another worm attacking Microsoft boxes is on the loose (see [CERT][1]). This is the second vulnerability in the past week or so targeting the NetBIOS ports. At the very least, block TCP/UDP ports 135,139 and 445 at the firewall. I sure do. Good thing, last time I checked the logs, I was blocking from 10 to 20 requests every second or two.
