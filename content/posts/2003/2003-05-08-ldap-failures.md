title: LDAP failures

I must've spend 4 hours trying to install, configure and connect to an
  

  
LDAP server ([OpenLDAP][1]) on a
  

  
FreeBSD box around here. During the process, for one reason or
  

  
another, I ended up having to upgrade and reconfigure PHP, Berkely DB
  

  
and who knows what else. It's running and I can connect to it, but
  

  
adding nodes just won't work. Oh well, I didn't need the sleep anyway.
