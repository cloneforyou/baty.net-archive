I was reading about [foldera](<http://www.foldera.com/>) and found this&#8230; 

> "Foldera has raised $13 million since its launch. Last week it completed a reverse merger into an existing (shell) public company, raising an additional $8.5 million. It is now a publicly traded (OTC) company with a market capitalization of $70 million." 

The thing hasn't even launched yet! I'm beginning to believe the folks who claim that Bubble 2.0 is upon us. Be afraid.
