{{< figure src="/img/2016/vise.jpg" title="Vise (2016). 4x5 Speed Graphic. HP5+ in R5 Monobath" >}}


There's something wrong with my process or my equipment. I took this photo of a
bench vise today using the Speed Graphic. It was lit using
the [Foldio](http://photojojo.com/awesomeness/foldio-portable-studio), shot on
HP5+ and processed in [R5 Monobath from New55](http://new55-film.myshopify.com/products/r5-monobath-developer?variant=8415508355)

I metered carefully, but it still ended up underexposed. What's worse, is that
the right one-third of the image is darker than the rest, and slightly
discolored. I corrected for the coloration problem, but something is still
wrong. I don't trust the R5 developer. I'll try again using D76 and see where I
get.
