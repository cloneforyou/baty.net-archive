Recently, Google was kind enough to release [Gmail Notifier][2] for OS X. This seemed like a better alternative, long-term, than what I had been using ([GmailStatus][3]), since it's, made by y'know, Google. The only thing lacking was [Growl][4] support. It turns out that [Gmail Notifier can use Plugins][5], and sure &#8216;nuff one of the first plugins available is [Gmail+Growl][6]. Marvy!
