Things were starting to sprawl around here, so I've consolidated some of the services I use.

First, I moved all of my private repos into Github. I'm already paying the $7/month so there was no increase in cost. I had a bunch of repos in Gitlab and a self-hosted Gitea instance. Now I _know_ where all of my repos are.

Second, I moved the files I was syncing with Syncthing back into Dropbox. I'd love to remove my depedency on Dropbox some day but I'm not ready for that yet, so now I _know_ where my synced files are and I don't have to worry about remembering how Syncthing works.

Third, I merged all of my personal notes into Apple Notes. I had things in Deft, The Archive, Bear, etc. I don't think Apple Notes will survive long-term but at least for today, if it's something personal, I _know_ where find it.

Fourth, I started using the Hobonichi Techo as my only daily planner/notebook. I now _know_ where I wrote it down.

I'm not sure how long it will be before I get bored and want to try something else, but for now it's nice not having to think about where things are.
