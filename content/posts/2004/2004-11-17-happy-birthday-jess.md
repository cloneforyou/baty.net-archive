My girl turned 16 yesterday. I've wondered what that would be like &#8211; and now I know. Teenagers are tough. If lately I've mentioned that a few too many times, I've mislead you. She's friendly, fun, fantastic, and quite simply my favorite person in the entire world, forever.

So what's it like? It's wonderful. Happy birthday baby girl.
