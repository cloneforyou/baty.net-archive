Clay Shirky video. [Here Comes Everybody: The Power of Organizing Without Organizations][1]. Some quotes (from memory)&#8230;

> "Sharing has become a platform for collaboration rather than vice versa"

> "Every <span class="caps">URL</span> is a latent community"

> "It's exactly the point that technology gets boring when its social aspects become interesting"

Fascinating. I'd read his [companion book][2], but it's not available on the Kindle.
