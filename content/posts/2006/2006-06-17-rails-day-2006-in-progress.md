The team at [Fusionary](<http://www.fusionary.com/>) has been hard at work for nearly 12 hours now.&nbsp; I'm not competing, just ordering Pizza and making sure [the server](<http://www.railsday2006.com>) stays running and nothing catches fire. Everyone's getting a little silly. 36 hours without sleep tends to do that. These guys have gotten an amazing amount of code coded and designs designed so far. 12 more hours to go.
