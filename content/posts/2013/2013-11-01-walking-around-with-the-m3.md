I hadn't shot a deliberate photo in a week, so I grabbed the M3 off the shelf, loaded it up with some HP5 and started walking. The goal was to keep going until the roll was used up.

I was thinking of it as more of a sketchbook of my walk, so I underexposed and
overdeveloped a bit. Then boosted the contrast even more, just to prove a point.
I like the results and it was a great exercise -- in more ways than one.
