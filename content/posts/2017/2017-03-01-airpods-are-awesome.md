I’m not going to write a long review or anything, but I did want to say
that I love the new Apple AirPods. They are the most Apple-like new
product I’ve used in a long time. After using the AirPods for a few
days, one wonders what the hell every Bluetooth headphone maker has been
doing for the past decade. I’ll forgive Apple the Siri-only interaction
model with this round, but they need to fix that. Otherwise, the entire
experience is wonderful.

Apple has (at least historically) been good at eliciting reactions like,
“Well, of course this is how it should work!” They’ve done it again with
the AirPods.
