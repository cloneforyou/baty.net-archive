Few things trigger my nostalgia meter more than Polaroid cameras and film. It&#8217;s not because I spent my childhood shooting Polaroids. I only had access to a Polaroid camera a few times. It&#8217;s theÂ _idea_ of Polaroid that I love. It&#8217;s the iconic shape of the instant SX-70 photos. It&#8217;s the genius of Edwin Land&#8217;s design of the SX-70. It&#8217;s [Andy Warhol][1].

I bought an original SX-70 several years ago when The Impossible Project (now [Polaroid Originals][2]) started making (or trying to make) integrated film. I shot a few boxes and it was fun but the film wasn&#8217;t great then. One day the camera just up and stopped working. It sat unused until a few months ago when I shipped it to Matt Widmann at [2nd Shot SX-70 Repair][3]. I received my repaired camera this week and it&#8217;s beautiful. The new SX-70 film from Polaroid Originals works well and is as fun as I remember (or imagined).

I&#8217;m looking forward to making lots of fun images with this camera.
