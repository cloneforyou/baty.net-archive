What concerns me is that if browser makers decide to set a "killbit" which prevents any use of Flash, what happens to all the Flash-only content created over the years? Many projects aren't worth rewriting in HTML5 or whatever just to avoid their delivery mechanism. That doesn't make them worthless. Is anyone thinking about this?
