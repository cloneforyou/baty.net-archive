I try to see every film that gets a Tomatometer reading of 90% and above at [Rotten Tomatoes][1]. [Eyes Without a Face][2], a French horror film from 1960 received a 100% rating. Nah. A few clever and interesting visuals couldn't mask (ha!) the fact that it was mostly boring and silly. Skip this one.
