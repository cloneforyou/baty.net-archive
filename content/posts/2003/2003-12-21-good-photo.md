I've been looking at a ton of photos and reading the corresponding "critiques" lately, trying to figure out what makes a good photograph. It's apparent that most people wouldn't know a worthwhile shot if it bit them in the ass. I know that _I_ certainly don't.

It occurs to me that comments like "I wouldn't have cropped that elbow" or "nice use of depth of field" or "damn that's tack sharp!" are completely useless as critical comments. Reading most photography-related forums would lead the casual observer to conclude that the only thing that's important in a photo is sharpness, which is of course complete crap.

I'm finding that what I like most about photography is that **I** get to decide what's good. Selfish, but satisfying!
