title: The Untouched Touch Bar
---

I don’t use the Touch Bar on my MacBook Pro for anything other than
Function keys and Touch ID. I love having Touch ID on a Mac, but man I
sure miss having real Function and Escape keys.

Maybe I’ll learn new behavior over time. Maybe there really is a decent
use for the Touch Bar. Right now though, I would swap the Touch Bar for
actual keys in a heartbeat. Also, still hate the keyboard.
