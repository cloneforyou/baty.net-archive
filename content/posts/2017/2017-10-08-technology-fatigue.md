title: Technology Fatigue
---

A few weeks ago I wrote that "Technology exhausts me." I was exaggerating to make a point, but it's still happening; and getting worse. I'm just not in the mood.

I'm not in the mood for any of my devices. I'm not in the mood for social media. I'm not in the mood for syncing, or two-factor authentication, or JavaScript frameworks, or WordPress issues, or Emacs hanging, or my Watch not seeing my phone, or firmware upgrades, or Alexa not turning on my lights, or any of dozens of other things I deal with daily. 

I'm suffering from technology fatigue and I think I need a break from the things that cause it.
