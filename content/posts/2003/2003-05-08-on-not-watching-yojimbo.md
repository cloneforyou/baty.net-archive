I'm supposed to be watching [yojimbo][1] right now&#8230; but I'm not. This is a symptom of a bigger problem, I think. I love Kurosawa, but for some reason I'm having trouble finding the energy to watch anything that makes me **think** too much. Today, my excuse is that I don't feel like reading subtitles. I'd rather watch Undercover Brother for the fifth time instead. What the hell is wrong with me?
