I defended Apple when they released a mouse that needed to be charged by plugging
the cable into the bottom. I said, "It only takes a few moments to charge, so
just plug it in and grab a coffee or whatever." I was wrong, I _hate_ charging
the mouse. I blow right by warnings that the batteries are "very low" and always
end up with a completely dead mouse at the worst times. Then, instead of plugging it into a
sensible location allowing me to continue working, I have to flip it on its side
first, and walk away for 10 minutes or so. It drives me nuts.

And every time I have to this with the Apple Pencil I just feel stupid.

These aren't improvements.
