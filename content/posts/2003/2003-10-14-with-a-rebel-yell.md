![Rebel][1]

After a sequence of events that I'd rather not go into here, I recently bought the [Canon Digital Rebel][2].

I've got a 6.3 Megapixel SLR with 35-zone AF Point-Linked Evaluative Metering
  

  
I've got a really nice Canon EF28-135 USM lens with image stabilization.
  

  
I've got all the [post-production][3] [software][4] I could ever need.

Now if I could just take an interesting picture.
