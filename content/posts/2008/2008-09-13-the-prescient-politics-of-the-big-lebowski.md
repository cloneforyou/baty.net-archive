<span class="drop_cap">M</span>y first time watching \_The Big Lebowski\_ was a terrible disappointment. I hated it. This came as a shock to me as I'd loved every other Coen film so much. Surely something was wrong. About a year later I gave it another shot and that was all it took. It's now one of my favorites. Strange how that works.

As much as I enjoy watching it, I've never really dug too deeply for any sort of meaning in the film. David Haglund has. From "Walter Sobchak, Neocon":http://www.slate.com/id/2199811/&#8230;

bq. Is this eerie foreshadowing of the second Iraq war coincidental? Not entirely. The Coen brothers created a character with traits that run deep in American culture: unflinching righteousness and a tendency to violence."
