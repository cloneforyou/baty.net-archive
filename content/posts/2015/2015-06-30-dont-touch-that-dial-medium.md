[Dave Pell][1]

> Apple’s Beats 1 radio station will be the most popular part of its music service. And it will spawn additional stations. And we’ll realize that while it sometimes pays to follow the technology, it can be just as fulfilling to follow the beaten path. And along that path, if you happen to see a few other heads moving to the same beat, all the better. Rock on. 

I think this is exactly right. Everyone seems to want to share everything so why not the shared experience of listening to the same thing at the same time as thousands of other people?
