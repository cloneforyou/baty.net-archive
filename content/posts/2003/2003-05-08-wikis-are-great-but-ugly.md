Wikis are a fantastic and drop-dead simple way to create a collaborative, multi-author web environment. My efforts to integrate them into the workflow at [Fusionary][1] have met with everything from reluctant acceptance to blank stares. A wiki is not supposed to be pretty, but I tend to agree with [this piece][2] explaining why the visual representation of most wikis can put off many potential users. I think I'll try a visual update to our internal wikis and see what the reaction is.
