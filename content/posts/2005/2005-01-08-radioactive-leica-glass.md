The [Leica forum][1] on Photo.net is a hoot. Although there are a number of retired dentist equipment fondlers who bore me to tears, there are also quite a few fun, smart and generally helpful people.

Today there was a discussion about why the glass used to make Leica lenses is (it is said) superior to most others. One response stated, in all seriousness, that it was "Special glass made with rare earths from the Carpathian Mountains." Another post chimed in and claimed that it couldn't be, since "&#8230;rare earth elements are often radioactive."

Then, almost immediately, this&#8230;

There is one naturally occuring isotope of lanthanum (La-138) that has a 110 billion year half-life which makes it essentially not radioactive for all but the most sensitive physics experiments. Its half-life is 100x longer than potassium-40, which we ingest in large amounts whenever we eat sources of food rich in potassium such as bananas. I have personally measured radioactivity in bananas and it is detectable.

Did you catch that? "I have personally measured radioactivity in bananas and it is detectable."

How can a fella not want to read every single thread, when there are people like that about?
