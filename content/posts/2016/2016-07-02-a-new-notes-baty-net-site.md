My fascination with static websites continues. I've sworn that this blog would remain in WordPress and so far I'm sticking with it, but I still like publishing static sites, so I've created a new version of my Notes blog: [notes.baty.net][1].

What I'm finding is that for quick notes and posts that are mostly text, I prefer using Emacs and Markdown, so [Hugo][2] works great. Posts with images or embedded videos are much easier to create using WordPress. This means that baty.net may become more focused on photography, with the notes.baty.net blog leaning more randomly technical.
