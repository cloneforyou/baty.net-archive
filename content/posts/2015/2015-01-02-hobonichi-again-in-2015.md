title: Hobonichi Again In 2015

I got my first [Hobonichi Planner][1] in 2013 and it quickly became a favorite. I've carried one with me ever since, and I plan to continue doing so in 2015.

<div id="attachment_4215" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="/img/2015/02/hobonichis.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4215" src="/img/2015/02/hobonichis.jpg" alt="Hobonichi notebooks" width="640" height="512" srcset="/img/2015/02/hobonichis.jpg 640w, /img/2015/02/hobonichis-300x240.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>

</div>

I use mine mostly as a calendar and appointment book. Yes, the iPhone is better at those things but what fun would that be? I also like to draw quick sketches representing the day's events. I try to do this every day but realistically it only happens a couple times a week.

<div id="attachment_4216" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignnone">
  <a href="/img/2015/02/hobonichi-page.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-4216" src="/img/2015/02/hobonichi-page.jpg" alt="A typical page from my planner" width="640" height="480" srcset="/img/2015/02/hobonichi-page.jpg 640w, /img/2015/02/hobonichi-page-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" /></a>

I find the Hobonichi Planner to be the perfect size. It's small enough to carry, but large enough to work with. The killer feature is the Tomoe River paper. The paper is very thin yet never bleeds through. Using such thin paper keeps the notebook compact, even though it contains 450 pages.

I love it.
