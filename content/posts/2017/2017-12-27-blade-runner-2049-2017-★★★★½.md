I very much enjoyed Blade Runner 2049. Seeing Harrison Ford emerge as older versions of characters he originally played 30+ years ago is my new favorite thing. I can&#8217;t wait to see him step out, wearing a cowboy hat, as Bob Falfa in &#8220;American Graffiti, the Next Generation&#8221; or whatever.

Roger Deakins has outdone himself here. I&#8217;m tempted to rewatch the film with the sound off, so I can just look at it. Every scene is gorgeous. I learned a new word while reading about it: &#8220;Chiaroscuro&#8221;.

I was concerned about Gosling as K but it turns out he&#8217;s very well-suited for the role.

On the other hand, Jared Leto remains a distraction. Thankfully his role here was, although important, limited.

Sylvia Hoeks was terrific as Luv and Ana De Armas reminded me that I have yet to watch &#8220;Her&#8221;.

Anyway, my concerns about the sequel to one of my favorite films were unfounded. &#8220;Blade Runner 2049&#8221; is a worthy continuation and a terrific movie on its own.
