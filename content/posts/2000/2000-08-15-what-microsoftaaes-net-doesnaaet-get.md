[What Microsoft&#194;'s .NET Doesn&#194;'t Get:][1]

Clay Shirky: "While Microsoft will certainly deliver pieces of the .NET suite over the next few years, the main purpose of the June announcement was FUD&#194;&#8211;the fear, uncertainty, and doubt about a competing technology that a good press release can plant in the minds of potential clients. And .NET isn&#194;'t just any old FUD either, but FUD of an epic, era-defining sort. With .NET, Microsoft is suggesting that this Internet thing has been a nice try, but that it probably isn&#194;'t going to pan out."
