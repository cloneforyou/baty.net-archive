From New Scientist: [13 Things that do not make sense](<http://www.newscientistspace.com/article.ns?id=mg18524911.600>).&nbsp; I like the fact that science not only admits that it doesn't know everything, but seems to \_enjoy\_ that fact. Incidentally, I suspect that the solution to 9 of the 13 specific things mentioned in the article will involve aliens.
