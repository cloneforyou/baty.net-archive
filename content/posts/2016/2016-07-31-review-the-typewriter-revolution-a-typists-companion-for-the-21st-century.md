[The Typewriter Revolution: A Typist's Companion for the 21st Century][1] by [Richard Polt][2]
  
My rating: [4 of 5 stars][3]

I'll probably read any new book about typewriters. It's nice to even have them. "The Typewriter Revolution" was thorough and informative. I could have done without the "Insurgency!" bits and probably didn't need the defensiveness around typists being called "hipsters". Otherwise, a fun read.
