To sum up&#8230;.

</p> 

  * Surfed (or tried surfing) on a beautiful beach near Pescadero for a couple days. 


  * Slept in Palapas with no doors or windows to speak of, and of course dogs walking in and out. 


  * Drank the world's greatest Margaritas in Todos Santos &#8211; a tiny town with a ton of fun hidden within it. Great food too.


  * Ate breakfast at Rosita's, a tiny "restaurant" that in the states one would probably not even drive by slowly. Good eggs though!


  * Fell off the bar that I was dancing on at a place called Squid Roe's in Cabo San Lucas after another successful search for a good margarita (or six).


  * Got lost and wandered the streets (alone) in the backwaters of Cabo at 3:00am. That was probably unwise. I finally flagged down a local in a van and begged him to drive me back to the hotel. He did, and it only cost me $US20. 


  * Recovered the following day by relaxing in the sun at the Hotel Finisterra's huge and beautiful pool.
</ul> 

I don't think I've ever had quite so much fun in quite so few days.
