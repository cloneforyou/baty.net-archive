title: I had Emacs open and it just happened
---

Remember that
time
[I decided to move all of my blogging to baty.blog](/2017/a-fresh-start-at-baty.blog/)?
That was fun, right?

I had Emacs open today and wanted to post something about playing with Known so
I just hit the usual key binding for a new blog post and started typing. When
finished I typed "make deploy" and poof!, it was published... to the archived
blog.

So in keeping with my history of never deciding anything for very long I put the
original theme back on baty.net and let it happen.

Now I have two blogs, I guess.
